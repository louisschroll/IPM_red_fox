  abstract = {▪ Abstract Recent theories regarding the evolution of predator-prey interactions is reviewed. This includes theory about the dynamics and stability of both populations and traits, as well as theory predicting how predatory and anti-predator traits should respond to environmental changes. Evolution can stabilize or destabilize interactions; stability is most likely when only the predator evolves, or when traits in one or both species are under strong stabilizing selection. Stability seems least likely when there is coevolution and a bi-directional axis of prey vulnerability. When population cycles exist, adaptation may either increase or decrease the amplitude of those cycles. An increase in the defensive ability of prey is less likely to produce evolutionary counter-measures in its partner than is a comparable increase in attack ability of the predator. Increased productivity may increase or decrease offensive and defensive adaptations. The apparent predominance of evolutionary responses of prey to predators over those of predators to prey is in general accord with equilibrium theory, but theory on stability may be difficult to confirm or refute. Recent work on geographically structured populations promises to advance our understanding of the evolution of predator-prey interactions.},

While camera traps are often used to assess fox activity, estimating abundance is difficult due to the inability to distinguish individuals requiring an ``unmarked'' methodology. We tested the ``simultaneous count method'' which requires samples to be independent during the sampling period, that is, 24 h, while allowing lack of independence between sampling periods. This enables repeat detections of animals to estimate abundance. We tested the method on camera data collected over 5 years at Oolambeyan National Park, New South Wales, during a fox control program and conclude that the method has merit. We were able to statistically measure an effect of change in abundance from a median of 57 to 2, however, estimation of detectability was erratic.},

We present an agent-based model of predator--prey dynamics where the agents (i.e. the individuals of either the predator or prey population) are able to move between different patches in a landscaped network. We then analyze population level and coexistence probability given node-centrality measures that characterize specific patches. We show that both predator and prey species benefit from living in globally well-connected patches (i.e. with high closeness centrality). However, the maximum number of prey species is reached, on average, at lower closeness centrality levels than for predator species. Hence, prey species benefit from constraints imposed on species movement in fragmented landscapes since they can reproduce with a lesser risk of predation, and their need for using anti-predatory strategies decreases.},

  abstract = {Forests within agricultural landscapes can act as safe harbourages for species that conflict with neighbouring landowners' interests, including mammalian predators. The agency responsible for the management of forests in upland Wales, UK, has permitted the killing of foxes (Vulpes vulpes) on their land as a ``good neighbour policy'' with the aim of reducing fox numbers. The principal method used was the use of dogs to drive foxes to a line of waiting shooters; a small number of foxes were also killed by shooting at night with a rifle. However, it has been postulated that recent restrictions on the use of dogs to kill foxes in Britain could lead to an increase in fox numbers in plantations. The aim of this study was to determine whether over-winter culling (i.e. driving foxes to guns using dogs and rifle shooting) in these forests acted to reduce fox density. Fox faecal density counts were conducted in commercial forests in Wales in autumn 2003 and spring 2004. Data were analysed from 29 sites (21 individual forests and 8 forest blocks, the latter consisting of pooled data from 20 individual forests). The over-winter change in faecal density was negatively related to the proportion of felled land and the proportion of land more than 400~m altitude, these associations probably reflecting reduced food availability. Over-winter change was positively associated with culling pressure (i.e. more foxes were killed where more foxes were present, or vice versa), but this was not significant. The number of foxes killed was large relative to the estimated resident population, but losses appeared to be negated (most likely) by immigration. Pre-breeding (spring) faecal density counts were significantly positively related to culling pressure, i.e. more foxes were killed with increased fox density or vice versa. Overall, there was no evidence to suggest that culling reduced fox numbers. Consequently, restrictions on the use of dogs to control foxes are unlikely to result in an increase in fox numbers in commercial forests.},

  abstract = {Introducing a new or extirpated species to an ecosystem is risky, and managers need quantitative methods that can predict the consequences for the recipient ecosystem. Proponents of keystone predator reintroductions commonly argue that the presence of the predator will restore ecosystem function, but this has not always been the case, and mathematical modeling has an important role to play in predicting how reintroductions will likely play out. We devised an ensemble modeling method that integrates species interaction networks and dynamic community simulations and used it to describe the range of plausible consequences of 2 keystone-predator reintroductions: wolves (Canis lupus) to Yellowstone National Park and dingoes (Canis dingo) to a national park in Australia. Although previous methods for predicting ecosystem responses to such interventions focused on predicting changes around a given equilibrium, we used Lotka--Volterra equations to predict changing abundances through time. We applied our method to interaction networks for wolves in Yellowstone National Park and for dingoes in Australia. Our model replicated the observed dynamics in Yellowstone National Park and produced a larger range of potential outcomes for the dingo network. However, we also found that changes in small vertebrates or invertebrates gave a good indication about the potential future state of the system. Our method allowed us to predict when the systems were far from equilibrium. Our results showed that the method can also be used to predict which species may increase or decrease following a reintroduction and can identify species that are important to monitor (i.e., species whose changes in abundance give extra insight into broad changes in the system). Ensemble ecosystem modeling can also be applied to assess the ecosystem-wide implications of other types of interventions including assisted migration, biocontrol, and invasive species eradication.},

We used samples of road carcasses collected by volunteers because this carnivore is an elusive species otherwise difficult to monitor with standard field protocols. We gathered 238 samples obtained from 2004 to 2022 from 13 different areas (8--31 samples/area). Using microsatellite loci, we identified 4 genetic units with gene flow among 3 of them in the Iberian Peninsula. The genetic variability was steadily low in 1 of the areas (Girona) for all the parameters evaluated. This area is also genetically isolated from the other studied areas. The inbreeding coefficient was significant in the north- and south-Iberia units, and we did not detect a bottleneck signature in any of the 4 genetic units. Future conservation actions should consider the genetic dissimilarity among detected units and elucidate the ecological factors that have led to the observed genetic patterns.},

We quantified wolverine (Gulo gulo) population trends from 2011 to 2020 in\,{$>$}\,14,000 km2 protected and non-protected habitat in southwestern Canada. We conducted wolverine and multi-species surveys using non-invasive DNA and remote camera-based methods. We developed Bayesian integrated models combining spatial capture-recapture data of marked and unmarked individuals with occupancy data. Wolverine density and occupancy declined by 39\%, with an annual population growth rate of 0.925. Density within protected areas was 3 times higher than outside and declined between 2011 (3.6 wolverines/1000 km2) and 2020 (2.1 wolverines/1000 km2). Wolverine density and detection probability increased with snow cover and decreased near development. Detection probability also decreased with human recreational activity. The annual harvest rate of {$\geq~$}13\% was above the maximum sustainable rate. We conclude that humans negatively affected the population through direct mortality, sub-lethal effects and habitat impacts.

As anthropogenic pressures increase worldwide, it is essential to understand how they influence the non-consumptive effects of predator-prey interactions. Two anthropogenic activities that occur worldwide, hunting and livestock grazing, are known to impact the activity and space use of individual species. However, their effects on predator-prey interactions remain less understood. We evaluated how cattle and human hunting activities influenced the spatial and temporal overlap of five predator (black bear [Ursus americanus], bobcat [Lynx rufus], cougar [Puma concolor], coyote [Canis latrans], and gray wolf [C. lupus]) and four ungulate prey species (elk [Cervus canadensis], moose [Alces alces], mule deer [Odocoileus hemionus], and white-tailed deer [O. virginianus]) in Washington, USA, from 2018 -- 2020. We used data from a large-scale camera trap study to test our hypotheses that anthropogenic activities influence spatiotemporal overlap of predators and prey depending on whether they avoid disturbance and risk or are attracted to potential food subsidies. We found cattle and hunter activity influenced species-specific occurrence and activity patterns but had more limited effects on predator-prey overlap. Namely, mesopredators and deer were generally more likely to use areas with cattle activity whereas cougars avoided cattle in the absence of wild prey. Predators and moose used areas with greater hunter activity, possibly creating a human shield for other ungulates where hunter activity was lower. Finally, most species moderately shifted their daily activity patterns in response to cattle and hunter activity. The resulting spatiotemporal patterns were only partially consistent with our expectations owing to the diverse and nuanced responses of predators and prey to cattle and hunter activity. Anthropogenic activities may help reduce predation risk under certain circumstances but do not necessarily create a human shield, underscoring the importance of considering anthropogenic effects on predator-prey interactions.},

Consequently, many species have been subjected to extensive control throughout portions of their range due to their integral role as generalist predators and reservoirs of zoonotic disease. Yet, few studies have monitored the effects of landscape composition or configuration on the demographic or behavioral response of mesopredators to population manipulation. During 2007 we removed 382 raccoons (Procyon lotor) from 30 forest patches throughout a fragmented agricultural ecosystem to test hypotheses regarding the effects of habitat isolation on population recovery and role of range expansion and dispersal in patch colonization of mesopredators in heterogeneous landscapes. Patches were allowed to recolonize naturally and demographic restructuring of patches was monitored from 2008--2010 using mark-recapture. An additional 25 control patches were monitored as a baseline measure of demography. After 3 years only 40\% of experimental patches had returned to pre-removal densities. This stagnant recovery was driven by low colonization rates of females, resulting in little to no within-patch recruitment. Colonizing raccoons were predominantly young males, suggesting that dispersal, rather than range expansion, was the primary mechanism driving population recovery. Contrary to our prediction, neither landscape connectivity nor measured local habitat attributes influenced colonization rates, likely due to the high dispersal capability of raccoons and limited role of range expansion in patch colonization. Although culling is commonly used to control local populations of many mesopredators, we demonstrate that such practices create severe disruptions in population demography that may be counterproductive to disease management in fragmented landscapes due to an influx of dispersing males into depopulated areas. However, given the slow repopulation rates observed in our study, localized depopulation may be effective at reducing negative ecological impacts of mesopredators in fragmented landscapes at limited spatial and temporal scales.},

  abstract = {Harvested wildlife populations should ideally be monitored to inform harvest policies and decision-making to help achieve management objectives. When the age of harvested individuals can be obtained, these data (i.e., age-at-harvest data) can be used to estimate trends of abundances, demographic rates, and harvest probabilities by the statistical reconstruction of the living population. This approach was developed primarily within the frequentist framework and requires the inclusion of auxiliary data (e.g., radiotelemetry data). We developed a novel Bayesian hierarchical approach allowing the population reconstruction from the definition of the species' life cycle without auxiliary data. The hierarchical model assumes that individuals are harvested from an open population whose fluctuations result from demographic processes, and the definition of a superpopulation composed of pseudo-individuals from which the harvested population is drawn. We evaluated the ability of our model to estimate abundances, survival, recruitment, and harvest probabilities based on simulations guided by the demographic processes of a long-lived mammal population. We considered model performance across scenarios, including varying age and temporal structures, superpopulation size, and prior information. We showed how prior information selected based on life history characteristics affects the accuracy of estimated parameters. We found that the model estimates accurate demographic parameters and abundances when the age-at-harvest matrix comprises more than two age classes. Furthermore, an increase in demographic information (number of age groups and years) increased the precision of the estimated parameters. We apply our model to a population of harvested (2012--2021) white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and a mammalian carnivore, the fisher (Pekania pennanti), from Rhode Island, USA. Our model estimated biologically realistic population size and demographic rates for both species. Our approach provides robustness to track the population abundance of harvested species through time and estimate fundamental demographic parameters. Such results can be used to monitor whether population objectives are being met and whether harvest policy changes are required. Furthermore, this information can be critical for evaluating the effect of harvest on population growth and projecting trajectories of age-structured populations under different harvest scenarios. Therefore, our framework can help to guide management decisions and species conservation.},

  abstract = {Abstract Context Ground-based shooting is widely used in management programs aiming to alleviate the impacts of invasive or overabundant wildlife populations. However, evaluations of individual shooting operations have shown variable results, and the effectiveness of ground-shooting as a population-management intervention has not been systematically examined. Aims Our review aimed to (1) assess the efficacy of shooting as a population management tool, and (2) identify commonalities among studies that will help managers identify situations where ground-shooting is most likely to be effective. Methods We systematically reviewed the literature to identify studies involving ground-shooting. From each study, we collated information about operational objectives, target taxa, geographic context, type of shooter used, effort, effectiveness, and use of additional control tools. Key results Most studies had no a priori quantifiable objectives. However, 60\% of the 64 case studies produced a detectable reduction in population density and/or damage. The most common type of operation used unpaid or commercial harvest-oriented shooters to reduce herbivore density or damage. Only 30\% of the operations that used volunteer shooters or recreational hunters achieved their objectives. Target taxa, geographic area or integration of shooting with other population-control methods had no detectable effect on the effectiveness of shooting operations. Common factors that hindered the effectiveness of shooting operations included immigration of target species from adjacent areas (n = 13), decreasing effort from shooters as the target population declined (n = 7) and selective harvesting (n = 7). Conclusions Ground-based shooting can be an effective management tool for overabundant wildlife populations, but many shooting operations did not achieve a notable decrease in animal abundance or damage. The source of failure could often be attributed to an inability to remove a sufficient proportion of the population to cause a population decline. Implications Managers contemplating using ground-based shooting to reduce the impacts or density of wildlife populations should (1) carefully consider whether this is a suitable management tool to achieve the desired outcomes, (2) establish clear objectives that aim to meet defined outcomes and allow for continuous improvement, and (3) ensure that operations are sufficiently resourced to achieve and maintain those objectives.},

  abstract = {Context Optimal management of invasive species should determine the interval between lethal-control operations that will sustain a desired population suppression at minimum cost. This requires an understanding of the species' rate of recruitment following control. These data are difficult to acquire for vertebrate carnivores such as the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), which are not readily trapped or observed. Aims To provide a long-term evaluation of the effects of 1080 poison baiting on the abundance and extent of movement of red foxes in a semiarid environment. Methods We used non-invasive DNA sampling of fox hairs in semi-arid Western Australia where the population was subject to two episodes of aerially delivered sodium fluoroacetate (1080) poison baits within 12 months. Sampling took place at {\textasciitilde}45-day intervals and individual foxes were identified by genotyping eight microsatellite DNA markers and a gender-specific marker. Open-population and spatially explicit mark--recapture models were used to estimate the density, apparent survival and movements of foxes before and following baiting. Key results Following a severe reduction in density after baiting, fox density during the ensuing 12 months increased slowly (0.01 foxes km--2 month--1), such that density had only reached 22\% of pre-baiting levels {\textasciitilde}10 months after the initial baiting. Moreover, recovery was non-linear as population growth was negligible for 6 months, then exhibited a nine-fold increase 7--9 months after control, coincident with the dispersal of juveniles in autumn. Fox movements between recaptures were on average 470\% greater after baiting than before, in line with expectations for low-density populations, suggesting that the probability of encountering baits during this period would be higher than before baiting. Conclusions Baiting with 1080 poison significantly reduced the density of foxes, and the low density was sustained for more than 6 months. Foxes moved significantly further between recaptures after baiting when at low densities. Implications Control programs in this region may be carried out at low frequency to suppress fox density to a fraction of unbaited levels. The intensity of follow-up baiting may also be adjusted downwards, to take account of an increased probability of bait encounter in more mobile foxes.},

  abstract = {1. Carnivore overabundance that results from exploitation of human derived resources can have numerous detrimental effects on local human populations and ecological communities. Experimental studies on the responses of overabundant carnivores to reductions of such resources are necessary to understand the effectiveness and impacts of resource reduction. 2. We conducted controlled experiments in two villages in which we drastically reduced the availability of anthropogenic food sources in half of each village. Spatial and numerical responses of radio-collared red foxes Vulpes vulpes were recorded and contrasted with those of radio-collared foxes in three similar untreated villages and pristine areas in the region. In total, we looked at survival rates of 134 foxes. 3. Prior to the resource manipulation, home range sizes (0{$\cdot$}47 and 0{$\cdot$}56 km2) and population densities (30 and 36 foxes km-2) in the two villages were comparable to documented low and high-end values, respectively. 4. Fast and distinct spatial responses were observed in response to the resource manipulation, and were manifested in either increased home range size or home range shifts. In one village, foxes exposed to reduced resource availability more than doubled their home range size. 5. Survival rates of individuals in the treated areas were drastically reduced. Actual fox mortality in the two treated areas reached 100\% and 64\% within 12 months of the onset of resource manipulation. Estimated monthly survival in the two treated areas declined from 0{$\cdot$}96--0{$\cdot$}98 and 0{$\cdot$}98--0{$\cdot$}99 ({$\sim$}0{$\cdot$}69 and 0{$\cdot$}78 derived annual survival) before treatment to 0{$\cdot$}80--0{$\cdot$}83 and 0{$\cdot$}92--0{$\cdot$}94 ({$\sim<$}0{$\cdot$}01 and 0{$\cdot$}42 derived annual survival) after treatment, respectively. By contrast, average monthly survivorship in pristine areas was nearly 0{$\cdot$}97 ({$\sim$}0{$\cdot$}69 annual survival) and in the untreated areas and other non-treated villages was 0{$\cdot$}95--0{$\cdot$}99 ({$\sim$}0{$\cdot$}54--0{$\cdot$}89 annual survival). 6. Synthesis and applications. This study demonstrates that sound waste disposal measures are very effective in controlling populations of overabundant carnivores. Contrary to common notion, the response of foxes to reduced resources was fast, manifested more by reduced survival than by successful dispersal into adjacent pristine areas. The results offer support to the Resource Dispersion Hypothesis regarding both home range size and density (suggested by the sharp decrease in survival) as a function of the spatial and temporal dispersion of resource.},

  abstract = {Abstract Vegetation structure affects predation risk in ecosystems around the world. Spinifex (Triodia spp.) is a foundation species in fire-prone grasslands and woodlands that cover more than a third of Australia's land surface. Spinifex habitats are known for their high reptile diversity, and it has long been hypothesized that the spiky structure of spinifex dissuades predators, thereby providing a haven for prey. We investigated predation risk to small lizards in semi-arid Australia by identifying teeth marks on replica model plasticine lizards, in combination with remote camera surveillance, to quantify and verify predation risk across several microhabitats, including spinifex. The introduced red fox (Vulpes vulpes) was identified as the main predator of lizard models, constituting 43.9\% of all predation attempts. Lizard models placed at the base of spinifex plants (Triodia scariosa) were significantly less likely to be attacked than all other microhabitat types (bare ground, leaf litter, burrows), confirming the hypothesis that spinifex reduces predation risk. Our results support recent work that has highlighted foxes as a significant predator of Australian reptiles. Given that fire is a driver of spinifex cover in arid ecosystems, our findings have implications for interactions between fire and invasive predators in Australian ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Understanding variation in the diet of widely distributed species can help us to predict how they respond to future environmental and anthropogenic changes. We studied the diet of the red fox Vulpes vulpes, one of the world's most widely distributed carnivores. We compiled dietary data from 217 studies at 276 locations in five continents to assess how fox diet composition varied according to geographic location, climate, anthropogenic impact, and sampling method. The diet of foxes showed substantial variation throughout the species' range, but with a general trend for small mammals and invertebrates to be the most frequently occurring dietary items. The incidence of small and large mammals and birds in fox diets was greater away from the equator. The incidence of invertebrates and fruits increased with mean elevation, while the occurrence of medium-sized mammals and birds decreased. Fox diet differed according to climatic and anthropogenic variables. Diet richness decreased with increasing temperature and precipitation. The incidence of small and large mammals decreased with increasing temperature. The incidence of birds and invertebrates decreased with increasing mean annual precipitation. Higher Human Footprint Index was associated with a lower incidence of large mammals and a higher incidence of birds and fruit in fox diet. Sampling method influenced fox diet estimation: estimated percentage of small and medium-sized mammals and fruit was lower in studies based on stomach contents, while large mammals were more likely to be recorded in studies of stomach contents than in studies of scats. Our study confirms the flexible and opportunistic dietary behaviour of foxes at the global scale. This behavioural trait allows them to thrive in a range of climatic conditions, and in areas with different degrees of human-induced habitat change. This knowledge can help us to place the results of local-scale fox diet studies into a broader context and to predict how foxes will respond to future environmental changes.},

The most utilized habitats were the maquis (scrubwood), meadows and pinewood. In the cold season the maquis was preferred to any other habitat, but in the warm months foxes made extensive use of meadows. On the other hand, no clear seasonal pattern of use was detectable for the pinewood. Food habits showed a seasonal variation: juniper berries were the staple food, forming by far the greatest part of the diet during the whole study, except in late spring through midsummer, when beetles and grasshoppers predominated. Availability indices for each main food category were calculated on a weekly basis. Distribution of juniper berries was found to be clumped, whereas insects were dispersed. It was also assessed that the former occurred almost entirely in the pinewood, while the latter inhabited mainly meadows and, to a lesser extent. the pinewood. Measures of fox activity in the three habitats were also taken. The fox diet correlated well to the seasonal abundance of the important food resources, which in turn was significantly correlated to meteorologic factors (temperature, number of rainy days). Surprisingly, the seasonal activity in the pinewood was inversely correlated to local food availability, i.e. juniper berries. This can be explained by the clumpedness of this food resource which, when abundant, allows foxes to become quickly satiated and to retreat to other, more preferred habitat such as the maquis. Such results caution against assuming that extensive time spent in a habitat is an indication of proportional feeding dependence on it.},

However, density is difficult to estimate reliably, since the ecological plasticity and elusive behavior of this carnivore hinder classic methods of inference. In this study, red fox population density was estimated using a non-invasive molecular spatial capture-recapture (SCR) approach in two study areas: one in a known hotspot of the zoonotic cestode Echinococcus multilocularis, and another na{\"i}ve to the parasite. Parasitological investigations on collected samples confirmed the presence of the parasite exclusively in the former area; the SCR results indicated a higher fox population density in the control area than in the hotspot, suggesting either that the relationship between fox density and parasite prevalence is not linear and/or the existence of other latent factors supporting the parasitic cycle in the known focus. In addition, fox spotlight count data for the two study areas were used to estimate the index of kilometric abundance (IKA). Although this method is cheaper and less time-consuming than SCR, IKA values were the highest in the areas with the lower molecular SCR density estimates, confirming that IKA should be regarded as a relative index only.},

Some case studies related to ecosystem management are briefly presented; these describe Lakes Victoria and Tanganyika, discarding from shrimp trawl fisheries and the development in the North Sea that led to introduction of multispecies analysis. The concept of `fishing down the food web' is discussed and the average trophic levels at which the fisheries operate in different ecosystem types are estimated based on quantified trophic flow models. On a global level, while on average fisheries operate around two trophic levels above the primary producers, still one third of the catch of the 70 major fish species caught in the world is of piscivorous fish. Using exploitation-predation rate indices for different ecosystem types, the amount of finfish consumed globally by finfish is roughly estimated to be three times the catches of finfish. Finally some implications for the management of ecosystems are drawn up. It makes little difference if short-term prognoses are based on single-species or multispecies considerations. Multispecies models may, however, give the better long-term advice, and adaptive management may facilitate the move towards such long-term goals.},

During four years, a culling protocol by night shooting from cars was implemented around the city of Nancy (eastern France) representing {$\sim$}1700h of night work and {$\sim$}15,000km driven. The 776 foxes killed represented an overall increase of 35\% of the pressure on the fox population over 693km2. Despite this consequent effort of culling, not only did night shooting of foxes fail to decrease the fox population, but it resulted in an increase in E. multilocularis prevalence from 40\% to 55\% while remaining stable in an adjacent control area (585km2). Though no significant change in age structure could be described, an increase in immigration and local recruitment is the best hypothesis for population resilience. The increase in prevalence is therefore considered to be linked to a higher rate of juvenile movement within the culled area shedding highly contaminated faeces. We therefore advocate managers to consider alternative methods such as anthelmintic baiting, which has been proven to be efficient elsewhere, to fight against alveolar echinococcosis.},

Reports are increasing of polecat population declines in several countries, although a paucity of data means population trends are poorly understood. This paper reviews and summarises information on the polecat's status and range-wide population trends. Information and opinion were gathered for 34 countries, from individuals and organisations studying polecats and from reviewing the literature and national Red Lists. Where trends were identified, the polecat population is known or suspected to be declining in 20 countries, reported to be stable in five countries, stable or increasing in one country, and increasing in two countries. For many countries, data are so limited in quantity or spatial scale, or at risk of bias, that trends could not be identified or confidence in trend assessments is low. The main drivers of polecat decline are poorly understood, but might include habitat degradation; changes in prey availability; competition with invasive carnivores; poisoning; conflict with human interests; harvesting and killing of polecats; and hybridisation. Robust survey methods and systematic monitoring programmes are urgently needed to gather up-to-date data on polecat population trends across the species' range.},

  abstract = {Over several decades, Western Europe experienced an outbreak of sylvatic rabies, eliminated through an EU programme involving large-scale red fox vaccination campaigns. While much work has been done on the dynamics of the virus and on the efficiency of vaccination campaigns, very little attention has been paid to the impact on the large-scale dynamics of the fox population. As Western Europe has now been free of rabies for about 15--20 years, the aims of this review are to characterise the impact of rabies during the outbreak itself and to increase understanding of how fox populations evolved thereafter. The rabies-free populations in the UK are also integrated as a comparative control. Trends in fox populations are based on a review of available data, mainly hunting statistics and a few other methods. The benefits and biases of these methods are also discussed. During the rabies epizootic, fox populations experienced a significant decline and stabilised at lower densities than observed in the past. A demographic explosion followed the vaccination campaigns, and fox populations became larger than had been observed before the epizootic. Rabies vaccination was not the direct cause of this demographic explosion, as rabies-free areas experienced it also. The causes are more to be sought in environmental modifications induced by humans. This demographic explosion was followed by the emergence of urban fox populations throughout Europe. Moreover, the new higher densities favoured the outbreak of other diseases, though their impact was more limited. Around the 2000s, rural fox populations appeared to reach densities close to carrying capacity and populations stabilised. However, subsequently, with some exceptions, Western European fox populations seem to be experiencing a decline. The ecological consequences of these changes in fox population density may reach the many prey species and competitors of the red fox.},

  abstract = {Daily activity patterns in mammals depend on food availability, reproductive stage, habitat selection, intraspecific interactions and predation risk, among other factors. Some mammals exhibit behavioral plasticity in activity patterns, which allows them to adapt to environmental changes. A good example of this can be found in the red fox Vulpes vulpes. This species is adapted to living in highly humanized environments, where it is often culled because it may affect human interests (e.g. through the consumption of game species or livestock). We assessed the potential main drivers of the daily activity patterns of the red fox in 12 Iberian Mediterranean areas through the use of camera traps. Among drivers, we considered main prey availability (European wild rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus), degree of human disturbance (e.g. distance to human settlements, and intensity of predator control) and habitat structure. Our results revealed a predominantly crepuscular and nocturnal activity of foxes with local variations. Although overall fox activity increased with rabbit availability, the temporal overlap with prey activity was on average low, because foxes increased activity when rabbits decreased theirs (twilight-night). Red fox activity rhythms seemed to be determined by human presence where human disturbance is high. In addition, diurnal activity decreased in areas with higher levels of human disturbance (closer to human settlements and high predator control intensity) and increased in dense habitats. Our study shows that daily activity patterns of highly adaptable species are determined by several interacting drivers, resulting in complex behavioral patterns. This suggests that further ecological studies should consider different factors simultaneously for a better understanding of daily activity patterns of wildlife in different landscapes.},

We provide a global metaanalysis of these impacts and reveal their full extent. Invasive predators are implicated in 87 bird, 45 mammal, and 10 reptile species extinctions---58\% of these groups' contemporary extinctions worldwide. These figures are likely underestimated because 23 critically endangered species that we assessed are classed as ``possibly extinct.'' Invasive mammalian predators endanger a further 596 species at risk of extinction, with cats, rodents, dogs, and pigs threatening the most species overall. Species most at risk from predators have high evolutionary distinctiveness and inhabit insular environments. Invasive mammalian predators are therefore important drivers of irreversible loss of phylogenetic diversity worldwide. That most impacted species are insular indicates that management of invasive predators on islands should be a global conservation priority. Understanding and mitigating the impact of invasive mammalian predators is essential for reducing the rate of global biodiversity loss.},

  abstract = {Invasive mammalian predators are major drivers of species extinctions globally. To protect native prey, lethal control is often used with the aim of reducing or exterminating invasive predator populations. The efficacy of this practice, however, is often not considered despite multiple practical and ecological factors that can limit success. Here, we summarize contemporary knowledge regarding the use and challenges of both lethal control and alternative approaches for reducing invasive predator impacts. As the prevailing management approach, we outline four key issues that can compromise the effectiveness of lethal control: release of herbivore and mesopredator populations, disruption of predator social systems, compensatory predator immigration, and ethical concerns. We then discuss the relative merits and limitations of four alternative approaches that may enhance conservation practitioner's ability to effectively manage invasive predators: top-predator conservation or reintroduction, maintaining habitat complexity, exclusion fencing, and behavioral and evolutionary ecology. Considerable uncertainty remains regarding the effectiveness of management approaches in different environmental contexts. We propose that the deficiencies and uncertainties outlined here can be addressed through a combination of adaptive management, expert elicitation, and cost-benefit analyses. Improved management of invasive predators requires greater consideration and assessment of the full range of management approaches available.},

In particular, how important are top-down effects of predators relative to direct and indirect human-mediated bottom-up and top-down processes? Combining data on species' occurrence from camera traps and hunting records, we aimed to quantify the relative effects of top-down and bottom-up processes in shaping predator and prey distributions in a human-dominated landscape in Transylvania, Romania. By global standards this system is diverse, including apex predators (brown bear and wolf), mesopredators (red fox) and large herbivores (roe and red deer). Humans and free-ranging dogs represent additional predators in the system. Using structural equation modelling, we found that apex predators suppress lower trophic levels, especially herbivores. However, direct and indirect top-down effects of humans affected the ecosystem more strongly, influencing species at all trophic levels. Our study highlights the need to explicitly embed humans and their influences within trophic cascade theory. This will greatly expand our understanding of species interactions in human-modified landscapes, which compose the majority of the Earth's terrestrial surface.},

Control of fox Vulpes vulpes, carrion crow Corvus corone, stoat Mustela ermina and weasel Mustela nivalis reduced the abundance of fox (-43\%) and crow (-78\%); no changes were detected in already low stoat or weasel abundances. 3. Reductions in foxes and crows led to an average threefold increase in breeding success of lapwing, golden plover, curlew, red grouse and meadow pipit. 4.

This assumption is violated in social, mobile prey, such as many ungulates. Here we use data from 80 monthly field censuses to estimate the parameters for a power relationship between herd density and population density for eight species of large herbivores commonly found in the diet of Serengeti lions, confirming a power relationship proposed from a preliminary Serengeti dataset. Here we extend our analysis of that model to demonstrate how parameters of the power function relate to average herd size and density-dependent changes in herd size and evaluate how interspecific variation in these parameters shapes the group-dependent functional response by Serengeti lions for eight prey species. We apply the different prey-specific functional response models in a Rosenzweig-MacArthur framework to compare their impact on the stability of predator--prey dynamics. Model outcomes suggest that group formation plays a strong role in stabilizing lion--herbivore interactions in Serengeti by forcing lions to search over a larger area before each prey encounter. As a consequence of grouping by their prey, our model also suggests that Serengeti lions are forced to broaden their diets to include multiple species of prey in order to persist, potentially explaining the generalist foraging by lions routinely recorded across multiple ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Many animal populations are subject to hunting or fishing in the wild. Detailed knowledge of demographic parameters (e.g. survival, reproduction) and temporal dynamics of such populations is crucial for sustainable management. Despite their relevance for management decisions, structure and size of exploited populations are often not known, and data limited. Recently, joint analysis of different types of demographic data, such as population counts, reproductive data and capture--mark--recapture data, within integrated population models (IPMs) has gained much popularity as it may allow estimating population size and structure, as well as key demographic rates, while fully accounting for uncertainty. IPMs built so far for exploited populations have typically been built as age-structured population models. However, the age of harvested individuals is usually difficult and/or costly to assess and therefore often not available. Here, we introduce an IPM structured by body size classes, which allows making efficient use of data commonly available in exploited populations for which accurate information on age is often missing. The model jointly analyzes size-at-harvest data, capture--mark--recapture--recovery data and reproduction data from necropsies, and we illustrate its applicability in a case study involving heavily hunted wild boar. This species has increased in abundance over the last decades despite intense harvest, and the IPM analysis provides insights into the roles of natural mortality, body growth, maturation schedules and reproductive output in compensating for the loss of individuals to hunting. Early maturation and high reproductive output contributed to wild boar population persistence despite a strong hunting pressure. We thus demonstrate the potential of size-class-structured IPMs as tools to investigate the dynamics of exploited populations with limited information on age, and highlight both the applicability of this framework to other species and its potential for follow-up analyses highly relevant to management.},

  abstract = {1 The European red fox Vulpes vulpes represents a continuing threat to both livestock and native vertebrates in Australia, and is commonly managed by setting ground-level baits impregnated with 1080 (sodium fluoroacetate) poison. However, the long-term effectiveness of such control campaigns is likely to be limited due to the ability of foxes to disperse over considerable distances and to swiftly recolonize areas from where they had been removed. 2 To investigate the effectiveness of fox baiting in a production landscape, we assessed the potential for foxes to reinvade baited farm property areas within the jurisdiction of the Molong Rural Lands Protection Board (RLPB), an area of 815 000 ha on the central tablelands of New South Wales, Australia. The spatial distribution and timing of fox baiting campaigns between 1998 and 2002 was estimated from RLPB records and mapped using Geographical Information System software. The effectiveness of the control campaign was assessed on the basis of the likely immigration of foxes from non-baited farms using immigration distances calculated from published relationships between dispersal distance and home range size. 3 Few landholders undertook baiting campaigns in any given year, and the area baited was always so small that no baited property would have been sufficiently far from an unbaited property to have been immune from immigrating individuals. It is likely, therefore, that immigration onto farms negated any long-term effects of baiting operations. This study highlights some of the key deficiencies in current baiting practices in south-eastern Australia and suggests that pest management programmes should be monitored using such methods to ensure they achieve their goals.},

The same species can be fully protected or heavily harvested on different sides of a border.

We tested this hypothesis on the wolverine (Gulo gulo) population of southern Scandinavia, which is shared between two countries: Sweden and Norway. Wolverines are fully protected in Sweden, but subject to intensive population regulation in Norway. Using non-invasive genetic sampling and capture--recapture modeling, we analyzed the dynamics of wolverine survival and emigration patterns between 2002 and 2013. Wolverines in Norway experienced a lower survival than in Sweden. Migration across the national border was directed towards movements from Sweden to Norway. There was a functional relationship between harvest rate in Norway and emigration rates across the national border, both at the individual and population level, thus confirming the compensatory immigration hypothesis. Contrasting management regimes within the same population can generate undesired demographic and spatial dynamics, jeopardize conservation goals on the two sides of a border, and reduce the efficiency of management actions. This calls for the adoption of a coordinate population approach in large carnivore conservation and management. Failing to do so can cause a waste of the already limited resources allocated for large carnivore conservation, and it might hinder effective conflict mitigation.},

  abstract = {Sharing space with large carnivores on a human-dominated continent like Europe results in multiple conflictful interactions with human interests, of which depredation on livestock is the most widespread. We conducted an analysis of the impact by all four European large carnivores on sheep farming in 10 European countries, during the period 2010--2015. We ran a hierarchical Simultaneous Autoregressive model, to assess the influence of several ecological factors on the reported depredation levels. About 35,000 (SD = 4110) sheep kills were compensated in the ten countries as caused by large carnivores annually, representing 0.5\% of the total sheep stock. Of them, 45\% were recognized as killed by wolves, 24\% by wolverines, 19\% by lynx and 12\% by bears. We found a positive relationship between wolf distribution and the number of compensated sheep, but not for the other three species. Depredation levels were lower in the areas where large carnivore presence has been continuous compared to areas where they disappeared and returned in the last 50 years. Our study shows that a few large carnivores can produce high damage, when the contribution of environmental, social, and economic systems predisposes for it, whereas large populations can produce a limited impact when the same components of the system reduce the probability that depredations occur. Time of coexistence plays in favour of a progressive reduction in the associated costs, provided that the responsible agencies focus their attention both on compensation and co-adaptation.},

This status places them at the heart of management conflicts wherein crop protection and health concerns are often raised against conservation issues. Here, a 20-year survey describes the effects of large variations in grassland vole populations on the densities and the daily theoretical food intakes (TFI) of vole predators based on roadside counts. Our results show how the predator community responded to prey variations of large amplitude and how it reorganized with the increase in a dominant predator, here the red fox, which likely negatively impacted hare, European wildcat, and domestic cat populations. This population increase did not lead to an increase in the average number of predators present in the study area, suggesting compensations among resident species due to intraguild predation or competition. Large variations in vole predator number could be clearly attributed to the temporary increase in the populations of mobile birds of prey in response to grassland vole outbreaks. Our study provides empirical support for more timely and better focused actions in wildlife management and vole population control, and it supports an evidence-based and constructive dialogue about management targets and options between all stakeholders of such socio-ecosystems.},

  abstract = {The relationship between predators and prey is thought to change due to habitat loss and fragmentation, but patterns regarding the direction of the effect are lacking. The common prediction is that specialized predators, often more dependent on a certain habitat type, should be more vulnerable to habitat loss compared to generalist predators, but actual fragmentation effects are unknown. If a predator is small and vulnerable to predation by other larger predators through intra-guild predation, habitat fragmentation will similarly affect both the prey and the small predator. In this case, the predator is predicted to behave similarly to the prey and avoid open and risky areas. We studied a specialist predator's, the least weasel, Mustela nivalis nivalis, spacing behavior and hunting efficiency on bank voles, Myodes glareolus, in an experimentally fragmented habitat. The habitat consisted of either one large habitat patch (non-fragmented) or four small habitat patches (fragmented) with the same total area. The study was replicated in summer and autumn during a year with high avian predation risk for both voles and weasels. As predicted, weasels under radio-surveillance  killed more voles in the non-fragmented habitat which also provided cover from avian predators during their prey search. However, this was only during autumn, when the killing rate was also generally high due to cold weather. The movement areas were the same for both sexes and both fragmentation treatments, but weasels of both sexes were more prone to take risks in crossing the open matrix in the fragmented treatment. Our results support the hypothesis that habitat fragmentation may increase the persistence of specialist predator and prey populations if predators are limited in the same habitat as their prey and they share the same risk from avian predation.},

  abstract = {Abstract: Non-native vertebrate predators pose a severe threat to many native species, and a variety of management programs are aimed at reducing predator effects. We sought to assess the effects of predator-control programs by analyzing changes in prey and predator populations based on data commonly collected in these programs. We examined data from a predator-control program that primarily targets the introduced red fox ( Vulpes vulpes regalis) in central California. Red foxes negatively affect populations of native waterbirds, particularly the endangered California Clapper Rail ( Rallus longirostris obsoletus). Using a combination of matrix population modeling, simple difference equations, and statistical analysis, we analyzed data on removed predators and monitored prey populations. Past control efforts succeeded in depressing fox numbers in local areas over 3-month intervals, and there was a significant, positive relationship between the growth rate of local Clapper Rail populations and the successful trapping of red foxes in the preceding year. By modeling the effect of different fox-removal rates, we found that a stable or declining population could be achieved by removing a minimum of 50\% of the adults and 25\% of the juveniles. Under trapping rates of 50--70\%, the proportion of the fox population composed of immigrants averaged 20--52\%. In contrast to the current management approach, elasticity analyses suggested that changes in adult survival rates had relatively little effect on long-term population growth. Overall, our approach indicated that predator control was effective in the short term, but for longer-term success it may be necessary to redirect efforts to control juvenile and immigrant foxes. Our analytical approach is potentially useful for evaluating current control programs aimed at reducing the effects of predators on native species.},

  abstract = {The impact of deliberate culling of fox populations has been much debated. Although a local ({$<$} 10 km2) impact has been accepted, previous authors have denied that culling has any impact on a larger scale because local losses are compensated through immigration. Rather, it has been claimed that at this scale fox density is determined by resources, mediated through social behaviour and breeding suppression. We determined the impact of culling on a regional scale ({$>$} 1000 km2), using data on culling (Heydon \& Reynolds, 2000), fox density (Heydon, Reynolds \& Short, 2000) and productivity. The three U.K. study regions (size 1238--2322 km2) were in mid-Wales (A), the east Midlands (B) and East Anglia (C). High productivity in regions A and C was associated with low density, high culling mortality and high overall mortality (all relative to region B), indicating that density was suppressed by culling. In region B (moderate) breeding suppression was associated with a higher density and lower cull than in regions A and C, implying that fox density was closer to the maximum sustainable by resources. We conclude that the impact of culling in different regions of Britain is variable, dependent on the regional prevalence, methods, and history of culling. However, it is clear that in a range of circumstances culling can substantially depress fox numbers, and that current fox densities reflect a history of culling. This conclusion is fundamental in considering the management of fox predation in farming and conservation contexts.},

  abstract = {Invasive predators are a key driver of biodiversity decline, and effective predator management is an important conservation issue globally. The red fox (Vulpes vulpes) poses a significant threat to wildlife, livestock and human health across Eurasia, North America and Australia. Despite worldwide investment in red fox management, decision makers still lack flexible tools for predicting control efficacy. We have developed FoxNet, a spatially explicit, individual-based model (IBM) framework that can be customised to predict red fox population dynamics, including responses to control and landscape productivity. High-resolution models can be run across northern and southern hemisphere landscapes. We present four case-study models to verify FoxNet outputs, explore key sensitivities and demonstrate the framework's utility as a management planning tool. FoxNet models were largely successful in reproducing the demographic structure of two red fox populations in highly contrasting landscapes. They also accurately generated the relationship between home-range size and fox-family density for home-range sizes between 1.0 and 9.6 km2, and captured the rapid decline and seasonally driven recovery of a red fox population following poison-baiting. An exploration of alternative poison-baiting scenarios for a conservation reserve predicted that current management suppresses red fox density by 70\% and showed that frequent baiting is required to combat recolonisation. Baiting at higher densities or establishing a baited buffer would further reduce red fox density. Predictions were sensitive to home-range and litter size assumptions, illustrating the value of region-specific data on red fox movement and biology. Synthesis and applications. We have developed a versatile individual-based model framework to guide management of the red fox, a globally significant invasive predator. Our framework, FoxNet, can be customised to generate realistic predictions of red fox population dynamics in diverse landscapes, making it immediately applicable to the design and optimisation of predator control programmes at scales relevant to management. Future extensions could explore competitor and prey responses to red fox control and the effects of habitat disturbance on predator population dynamics.},

  abstract = {Abundance and distribution of food resources directly influence adaptative foraging strategies, which are strongly related to individual fitness and population demography. Specialization toward food resources is commonly observed in predator species, both at population and individual levels. When predation of livestock occurs, human-wildlife conflicts rise and livestock producers require efficient management of predators. In the Bresse region (eastern France), free-ranging poultry farms annually suffer from losses due to predation of chickens by several bird and mammal species, including red foxes (Vulpes vulpes). We quantified the diet of several red foxes in this region and investigated dietary specialization on chicken using stable isotope analysis. Vibrissae (i.e. whiskers) of 68 wild foxes sampled throughout the year were cut into fragments to measure inter- and intra-individual variability of diet, allowing us to reconstruct the diet of individual foxes on an average of 134~days. At the population level, over 70\% of the diet was composed of rodents and chickens. Within the population, we found contrasting carbon isotopic signatures, indicating that some foxes preferentially consumed prey with high {$\delta$}13C values, likely corresponding to Bresse chickens fed with maize, while others consumed wild food resources. We estimated that 4.4\% (i.e. 3/68 foxes) of the fox population was composed of individuals that specialized in predating chicken. Chicken predation was higher in females than males and occurred more often in summer, when females were rearing kits. The availability of an easily catchable food resource could explain why some red foxes included chickens in their diet. These results call for management actions focused on specialized foxes.},

  abstract = {Pest control is a global issue for agriculture, health, biodiversity conservation and economy. Anticoagulant rodenticides are used over large areas to control rodent pests and can cause widespread poisoning of nontarget wildlife. In France, bromadiolone is the only pesticide authorized to control the water vole Arvicola terrestris Scherman, in grasslands. Since 2001, legislation has been in place to replace curative treatments by preventive ones and limit the quantity of rodenticide used. As the legislation took effect over time, the impact on red fox Vulpes vulpes populations was monitored. Fox populations and bromadiolone treatments were monitored in the Doubs Department (5000 km{$^2$} area), France. Fox counts were carried out during spring, and vole control was primarily conducted in autumn. Relative fox densities (Kilometric Abundance Index: KAI) obtained per commune for year n (2004--2009) were related to treatments achieved during year n-1 (2003--2008). Treatments from year n-2 were used to investigate possible delayed responses in fox populations. Kilometric Abundance Index of foxes was significantly related to treatment intensities in years n-1 and n-2. The impact was greatest in a large area ({$>$}1000 km{$^2$}), where intensive treatments were achieved in 2003. Fox KAI generally remained dramatically low in this area until 2005, after which a partial recovery was observed. The same area was treated again from 2006 to 2008 but with only half the amount of bait per hectare that was used in 2003. These treatments were followed by a moderate decrease in fox populations. Synthesis and applications: We have established, for the first time on a regional scale, the negative impact of a rodenticide on fox populations. We have shown that a shift to preventive treatments with reduced anticoagulant rodenticide use is less harmful to fox populations. However, to approach a zero impact, treatments should be reduced further by limitation of bait quantities authorized per hectare and per commune and using alternative methods to chemical control. Long-term monitoring of wildlife populations using index methods can provide valuable information about the adverse effects of pesticides; therefore, we recommend their inclusion in the assessment of pest management practices.},

A large-scale natural predator removal experiment occurred when an outbreak of sarcoptic mange (Sarcoptes scabiei) reduced the red fox population initially and caused subsequent variations in red fox abundance. We estimated relative red fox abundance by dividing number of fox observations with number of person-days in field. Red fox predation accounted for 88\% of known mortality in roe deer fawns. Predation was closely correlated to red fox abundance, and there was a strong negative correlation between fox abundance and overall fawn survival. Fox abundance was the only factor with a significant effect on between year variation in fawn survival. Annual predation varied between zero and 90\%. Our study recorded the highest predation rates for roe deer juveniles established to date. High fawn survival in years of low fox abundance suggested that predation mortality was additive during summer. Our results supported the conclusion that the large national increase of roe deer in Sweden during the 1980s and 1990s was related to lower fox predation on fawns and also indicated that the roe deer population density was well below habitat carrying capacity at the onset of the mange epidemic. In Sweden, in general, a thorough fox control will most likely result in increased fawn survival and higher potential roe deer harvest.},

  abstract = {Estimating animal abundance is essential for research, management and conservation purposes. Although reliable methods exist to estimate absolute density for populations with individually marked animals, robust relative abundance indices (RAIs) may allow to track changes in population size when individual identification is not possible. Their performance, however, needs be thoroughly evaluated. We investigated the relative performance of several common faeces-based and camera-based RAIs for estimating small-scale variation in red fox abundance, a mesopredator of high relevance for management, in two different study areas. We compared precision, cost and performance of the methods in capturing relationships with covariates of local abundance. Random transect-based RAIs had a low mean, a comparatively high coefficient of variation and a high proportion of zeros, prohibiting or impeding analysis in relation to environmental predictors. Rectangular scat plots and transects along linear landscape features had an intermediate amount of zeros while retaining a high precision, but were less sensitive to local variation in abundance related to environmental predictors and required a large field effort. Camera trap-based RAIs yielded low to intermediate precision, but were more sensitive to small-scale variation in relative abundance than faeces-based methods. Camera traps were the most expensive methods for an initial monitoring session, but required the lowest field effort, were cheapest in the long run and were the least susceptible to observer bias and detection error under a robust sampling protocol. Generally, faeces count-based RAIs appear more suitable for studies that aim to compare local abundance between several study sites of equal landscape composition under constant detection probability. Camera traps provide more flexible data for studies that require accounting for influences of landscape composition on local abundance and are more cost-effective for long-term or continuous monitoring and more suitable to achieve high replication. Accordingly, the choice of the most suitable method and plot design is context-dependent.},

Predator control by means of culling is frequently employed to benefit threatened prey species or to increase the abundance of small game species for hunting. The red fox (Vulpes vulpes), a generalist mesopredator of global relevance, is a major target of predator control. Commonly, in central Europe, red fox culling efforts intended to benefit prey species remain restricted to small areas. It is unclear, however, whether such restricted-area culling effectively lowers predation risk at a site or whether red fox abundance is more important than culling in shaping predation risk. We conducted an experiment using 273 camera supervised artificial nests at multiple study sites in clusters of hunting concessions with or without targeted fox culling in a fragmented montane forest landscape in Germany.},

  abstract = {Predators are often culled to benefit prey, but in many cases this conservation goal is not achieved or results remain unknown. The red fox (Vulpes vulpes) is a predator of global significance, and an invasive species in some regions. Red fox culls intended to benefit prey are often restricted to small areas, and effectiveness is rarely sufficiently evaluated. Given the economic, ecological, social, and welfare issues associated with lethal predator control, there is a strong need to assess the effects of spatiotemporal variation in culling intensity on red fox abundance. We surveyed red fox populations in fragmented forests of south-western Germany and related indices of local fox abundance to culling data, predicted landscape-scale fox abundance, and other covariates. We tested whether restricted-area culling was associated with local reductions in fox abundance, and examined how this relationship changed over time. Local fox abundance was temporarily reduced in spring, following winter culls. However, the effect was minor and fox populations had compensated for the reductions at the latest by autumn. Restricted-area culling therefore likely failed to sustain effects on fox abundance throughout the period most relevant for conservation (i.e., the reproductive period of the target prey species). To be effective as a conservation tool, culling will therefore require explicit spatiotemporal coordination matching the biology of predators and target prey.},

  abstract = {Assessing the non-lethal effects of disturbance from human activities is necessary for wildlife conservation and management. However, linking short-term responses to long-term impacts on individuals and populations is a significant hurdle for evaluating the risks of a proposed activity. The Population Consequences of Disturbance (PCoD) framework conceptually describes how disturbance can lead to changes in population dynamics, and its real-world application has led to a suite of quantitative models that can inform risk assessments. Here, we review PCoD models that forecast the possible consequences of a range of disturbance scenarios for marine mammals. In so doing, we identify common themes and highlight general principles to consider when assessing risk. We find that, when considered holistically, these models provide valuable insights into which contextual factors influence a population's degree of exposure and sensitivity to disturbance. We also discuss model assumptions and limitations, identify data gaps and suggest future research directions to enable PCoD models to better inform risk assessments and conservation and management decisions. The general principles explored can help wildlife managers and practitioners identify and prioritize the populations most vulnerable to disturbance and guide industry in planning activities that avoid or mitigate population-level effects.},

Most past projections of the effects of climate change on species distribution have ignored biological interactions. We evaluated to what degree incorporating prey availability into climatic-based SDMs would change the predicted future distribution of the Asiatic cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus venaticus) and the Persian leopard (Panthera pardus saxicolor). We projected climate niches using (1) only the climatic variables; (2) both climatic and prey availability data. When we based inferences on models that did not account for prey availability, we predicted that the range of the Asiatic cheetah would contract by 42\% between current and future under a low-emissions scenario, whereas the range of the Persian leopard would expand by 9\%. Adding the effects of prey availability into the model did not affect predictions for the Asiatic cheetah (41\% range contraction), but did alter predictions for the Persian leopard, whose range was expected to contract by 25\%. Persian leopards are predicted to be less affected by climate change when the analysis considers climatic variables only, but when models are integrated with the prey data, large habitat losses are predicted. Our results show that there can be complex and large interactions between climate change and other limiting ecological resources which must be accounted for in SDMs. It is therefore important to integrate biotic interactions and the temporal dynamics of species distribution induced by climate change into conservation planning to optimally plan the spatial distribution of conservation areas.},

However, information to forecast population-level consequences of such changes is often lacking. We developed an interim framework to assess the population consequences of disturbance when empirical information is sparse. We show how daily effects of disturbance, which are often straightforward to estimate, can be scaled to the disturbance duration and to multiple sources of disturbance. We used expert elicitation to estimate parameters that define how changes in individual behaviour or physiology affect vital rates and incorporated them into a stochastic population model. Model outputs can be used to evaluate cumulative impacts of disturbance over space and time. As an example, we forecast the potential effects of disturbance from offshore wind farm construction on the North Sea harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) population. Synthesis and applications. The interim framework can be used to forecast the effects of disturbances from human activities on animal populations, to assess the effectiveness of mitigation measures and to identify priority areas for research that reduces uncertainty in population forecasts. The last two applications are likely to be important in situations where there is a risk of unacceptable change in a species' conservation status. The framework should, however, be augmented with empirical data as soon as these are available.},

  abstract = {Context Predator-control aims to reduce an impact on prey species, but efficacy of long-term control is rarely assessed and the reductions achieved are rarely quantified. Aims We evaluated the changing efficacy of a 58-year-long campaign against red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) on Phillip Island, a 100-km2 inhabited island connected to the Australian mainland via a bridge. The campaign aimed to eliminate the impact of foxes on ground-nesting birds, particularly little penguins (Eudyptula minor). Methods We monitored the success rate of each fox-control technique employed, the level of effort invested if available, demographics of killed foxes, the numbers of penguins killed by foxes and penguin population size. Key results The campaign began as a bounty system that ran for 30 years and was ineffective. It transitioned into a coordinated, although localised, control program from 1980 to 2005 that invested considerable effort, but relied on subjective assessments of success. Early during the control period, baiting was abandoned for less effective methods that were thought to pose fewer risks, were more enjoyable and produced carcasses, a tangible result. Control was aided by a high level of public awareness, by restricted fox immigration, and by a clear, achievable and measurable target, namely, to prevent little penguin predation by foxes. Carcasses did prove valuable for research, revealing the genetic structure and shifts in fox demographics. The failure of the program was evident after scientific evaluation of fox population size and ongoing fox impacts. In 2006, the campaign evolved into an eradication attempt, adopting regular island-wide baiting, and since then, has achieved effective knock-down of foxes and negligible predation on penguins. Conclusions Effective predator control was achieved only after employing a dedicated team and implementing broad-scale baiting. Abandoning widespread baiting potentially delayed effective control for 25 years. Furthermore, both predator and prey populations should be monitored concurrently because the relationship between predator abundance and impact on prey species is not necessarily density dependent. Implications Critical to adopting the best management strategy is evaluating the efficacy of different methods independently of personal and public biases and having personnel dedicated solely to the task.},

  abstract = {Evaluating the role of fishes at the food web and ecosystem scales profits from an iterative process. At the community and population scales, prey selection by predators alters habitat selection behaviours of prey species as well as their abundance, size distributions, life histories and the consequent effects on their own prey. At the whole system scale, predation by fishes alters community structure and nutrient cycling. Thus, both direct and indirect predation effects are expressed in population structure, community composition and production processes at all trophic levels. These are the central tenets of the trophic cascade argument. Examples are abundant and diverse. We know that predators are size selective, that resource partitioning occurs, that functional responses link the density dependence of predator and prey populations, and that predator avoidance behaviours are common. A more significant challenge exists when attempting to use this knowledge. This presentation attempts to link theory and empiricism in forecasts of what will happen next in response to a management action or a planned experiment. Examples are drawn from whole system experiments conducted in small lakes and from large-scale manipulations of predator populations in North America's Laurentian Great Lakes. Rapid and discontinuous or non-linear responses are common. Extrapolating the lessons of mechanistic process studies proves insufficient because the context is dynamic. Inferences built from the whole ecosystem scale yield equally misleading results because the scale is too general, Resolving these problems will require a clever mix of selective applications of predator-prey theory and astute empiricism.},

To close the gap between contemporary reality and demographic theory, we develop a set of transient life table response experiments (LTREs) for decomposing realised population growth rates into contributions from specific vital rates and components of population structure. Using transient LTREs in a theoretical framework, we reveal that established concepts in population biology will require revision because of reliance on approaches that do not address the influence of unstable population structure on population growth and mean fitness.

  abstract = {Identifying the demographic parameters (e.g., reproduction, survival, dispersal) that most influence population dynamics can increase conservation effectiveness and enhance ecological understanding. Life table response experiments (LTRE) aim to decompose the effects of change in parameters on past demographic outcomes (e.g., population growth rates). But the vast majority of LTREs and other retrospective population analyses have focused on decomposing asymptotic population growth rates, which do not account for the dynamic interplay between population structure and vital rates that shape realized population growth rates in time-varying environments. We provide an empirical means to overcome these shortcomings by merging recently developed ``transient life-table response experiments'' with integrated population models (IPMs). IPMs allow for the estimation of latent population structure and other demographic parameters that are required for transient LTRE analysis, and Bayesian versions additionally allow for complete error propagation from the estimation of demographic parameters to derivations of realized population growth rates and perturbation analyses of growth rates. By integrating available monitoring data for Lesser Scaup over 60 yr, and conducting transient LTREs on IPM estimates, we found that the contribution of juvenile female survival to long-term variation in realized population growth rates was 1.6 and 3.7 times larger than that of adult female survival and fecundity, respectively. But a persistent long-term decline in fecundity explained 92\% of the decline in abundance between 1983 and 2006. In contrast, an improvement in adult female survival drove the modest recovery in Lesser Scaup abundance since 2006, indicating that the most important demographic drivers of Lesser Scaup population dynamics are temporally dynamic. In addition to resolving uncertainty about Lesser Scaup population dynamics, the merger of IPMs with transient LTREs will strengthen our understanding of demography for many species as we aim to conserve biodiversity during an era of non-stationary global change.},

Understanding when phenotypic change underlies population responses to environmental change is important for obtaining insights and robust predictions of population dynamics in a changing world. We develop a dynamic integral projection model that mechanistically links environmental conditions to demographic rates and phenotypic traits (body size) via changes in resource availability and individual energetics. We apply the model to the northern Yellowstone elk population and explore population responses to changing patterns of seasonality, incorporating the interdependence of growth, demography, and density-dependent processes operating through population feedback on available resources. We found that small changes in body size distributions can have large impacts on population dynamics but need not cause population responses to environmental change. Environmental changes that altered demographic rates directly, via increasing or decreasing resource availability, led to large population impacts in the absence of substantial changes to body size distributions. In contrast, environmentally driven shifts in body size distributions could occur with little consequence for population dynamics when the effect of environmental change on resource availability was small and seasonally restricted and when strong density-dependent processes counteracted expected population responses. These findings highlight that a robust understanding of how associations between body size and demography influence population responses to environmental change will require knowledge of the shape of the relationship between phenotypic distributions and vital rates, the population status with regard to its carrying capacity, and importantly the nature of the environmentally driven change in body size and carrying capacity.},

  abstract = {Predators shape ecosystem structure and function through their direct and indirect effects on prey, which permeate through ecological communities. Predators are often perceived as competitors or threats to human values or well-being. This conflict has persisted for centuries, often resulting in predator removal (i.e. killing) via targeted culling, trapping, poisoning, and/or public hunts. Predator removal persists as a management strategy but requires scientific evaluation to assess the impacts of these actions, and to develop a way forward in a world where human-predator conflict may intensify due to predator reintroduction and rewilding, alongside an expanding human population. We reviewed literature investigating predator removal and focused on identifying instances of successes and failures. We found that predator removal was generally intended to protect domestic animals from depredation, to preserve prey species, or to mitigate risks of direct human conflict, corresponding to being conducted in farmland, wild land, or urban areas. Because of the different motivations for predator removal, there was no consistent definition of what success entailed so we developed one with which to assess studies we reviewed. Research tended to be retrospective and correlative and there were few controlled experimental approaches that evaluated whether predator removal met our definition of success, making formal meta-analysis impossible. Predator removal appeared to only be effective for the short-term, failing in the absence of sustained predator suppression. This means predator removal was typically an ineffective and costly approach to conflicts between humans and predators. Management must consider the role of the predator within the ecosystem and the potential consequences of removal on competitors and prey. Simulations or models can be generated to predict responses prior to removing predators. We also suggest that alternatives to predator removal be further developed and researched. Ultimately, humans must coexist with predators and learning how best to do so may resolve many conflicts.},

  abstract = {Invasive mammalian predators are implicated in the ongoing decline of a suite of fauna and continue to be a major cause of human--wildlife conflict globally. Lethal control of invasive predators is a common management strategy; however, the use of activity indices to measure management effectiveness is problematic. Non-invasive genetic sampling may be a viable alternative approach to monitoring as individual animals can be identified, allowing for direct estimation of population density through newly developed spatially explicit capture--recapture techniques. Here we compare inferences derived from a basic activity index (number of scats per survey) and genetic sampling of scats within a before--after control--impact design to evaluate the effectiveness of a lethal control programme targeting red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) in south-eastern Australia. The activity index was highly variable through time and suggested the baiting programme reduced fox activity on the treatment transect relative to changes on the non-treatment transect. In contrast, genetic sampling and spatially explicit capture--recapture analysis suggested fox density varied little throughout the study, with any changes unable to be attributed to the baiting programme. Additionally, genetic sampling confirmed many individuals persisted through 7 months of baiting. These contrasting results may be partially explained by changes in scat detectability due to seasonal changes in behaviour and the disproportionate contribution of some individuals to scat counts. Our pre-baiting density estimate of 0.28 foxes km2 (95\% CI: 0.22--0.38) was lower than expected given the high productivity, abundant prey species and lack of larger predators in the study region. Our results highlight the need for cautious interpretation of activity indices and demonstrates the value of incorporating recent methodological and statistical advances when evaluating lethal control programmes.},

  abstract = {The ageing theory predicts fast and early senescence for fast-living species. We investigated whether the pattern of senescence of a medium-sized, fast-living and heavily-culled mammal, the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), fits this theoretical prediction. We used cross-sectional data from a large-scale culling experiment of red fox conducted over six years in five study sites located in two regions of France to explore the age-related variation in reproductive output. We used both placental scars and embryos counts from 755 vixens' carcasses aged by the tooth cementum method (age range: 1--10), as proxies for litter size. Mean litter size per vixen was 4.7 {\textpm} 1.4. Results from Generalized Additive Mixed Models revealed a significant variation of litter size with age. Litter size peaked at age 4 with 5.0 {\textpm} 0.2 placental scars and decreased thereafter by 0.5 cubs per year. Interestingly, we found a different age-specific variation when counting embryos which reached a plateau at age 5--6 (5.5 {\textpm}0.2) and decreased slower than placental scars across older ages, pointing out embryo resorption as a potential physiological mechanism of reproductive senescence in the red fox. Contrary to our expectation, reproductive senescence is weak, occurs late in life and takes place at an age reached by less than 11.7\% of the population such that very few females exhibit senescence in these heavily culled populations.},

  abstract = {Aim Identifying the variables that influence animal home range size is important for understanding the biological requirements of individuals and their social interactions. Given their often broad distributions, carnivores are model organisms for studying range-wide determinants of home range size. Here, we test predictions about environmental determinants of home range size for one of the world's most widely distributed carnivores, the red fox (Vulpes vulpes). Location Global. Methods We compiled a database of 70 mean home range estimates from 62 studies and four continents, which we analysed according to site-based temperature, precipitation, environmental productivity and human influence variables. Results We found a very strong negative effect of the Human Footprint Index (HFI), with fox home range size decreasing as the level of human impact increased. When analysing the constituent components of the HFI separately, we found that human population density was the only well-supported variable (cf. built environments, croplands, pasture lands, nightlights, railways, roads and navigable waterways). Predicted home range size at the highest human population densities (0.75 km2) was 93\% lower than at the lowest population densities (10.83 km2). We also found that home range size increased as mean annual temperature and temperature seasonality increased. The analyses did not support our prediction that home ranges would be smaller in areas of higher environmental productivity or precipitation. Main conclusions Smaller home range sizes observed in highly disturbed areas can be attributed to increased food availability from anthropogenic sources. The lack of an effect of environmental productivity contrasts with previous studies that have shown a negative relationship with carnivore home range size. It may be that anthropogenic food sources have negated the impacts that low-productivity environments have on fox home ranges. Our results emphasize the strong potential for human activities to transform animal space use across the globe.},

  abstract = {Small mammalian carnivores (Carnivora {$<$}16~kg) carry out important roles in ecosystems, such as influencing ecosystem structure and providing numerous ecosystem services. Despite their importance, there are contrasting views on the required conservation and management needs for species within this group. In a review of the IUCN Red List species-level assessments, we found that 53 small carnivore species were threatened (CR, EN, or VU) compared to 15 large. However, there were similar proportions of large (4\%, 9\%) and small (1\%, 9\%) carnivores endangered with extinction (CR or EN, respectively). We did not find support for small carnivores benefiting from mesopredator release in a global context; more than half of both large and small carnivore species decreasing, suggesting parallel declines. On average, large carnivores received their first IUCN assessment 10~years before small and, since their first assessment, small carnivores have received fewer assessments than large, highlighting the disparity in conservation attention within the guild. The leading threats for all carnivores include biological resource use and land use change. We review the major threats to threatened small carnivores and suggest areas for priority research and conservation. Collectively, we show that small carnivores are as endangered with extinction as are large carnivores, and that small carnivores should be of conservation concern globally, but particularly in species-rich regions of Southeast Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and Madagascar. To inform conservation, we encourage more research into the basic ecology and demography of small carnivores, particularly regarding current and future threats in the face of global change.},

Contrary to a pervasive view, we suggest that, among Carnivora, small carnivores are more appropriate sentinels than large carnivores. This reasoning is built around six key points: that, compared to large carnivores, small carnivores 1) are more species-rich and diverse, providing more potential sentinels in many systems; 2) occupy a wider range of ecological niches, exhibiting a greater variety of sensitivities to change; 3) hold an intermediate trophic position that is more directly affected by changes at the producer, primary consumer, and tertiary consumer levels; 4) have shorter life spans and higher reproductive rates, exhibiting more rapid responses to change; 5) have smaller home ranges and are more abundant, making it easier to investigate fine-scale management interventions; 6) are easier to monitor, manage, and manipulate. Therefore, we advocate for incorporating a middle-out approach, in addition to the established top-down and bottom-up approaches, to assessing the responses of ecosystems to global change.},

The main methods of controlling foxes rely on poison baiting, den fumigation and den destruction. There are concerns that ongoing use of poisons and fumigants may become unacceptable on the grounds of humaneness. Additional control options that are humane and effective need to be investigated. In this study we developed models to examine the efficacy of using contraceptive agents as an alternative method of control for fox populations. The models simulated the dynamics of structured (by age and sex) fox populations. The models were then used to identify the level of infertility required to achieve target levels of control, the need for ongoing maintenance, and the benefits of an integrated pest management strategy that included lethal control. The models indicated that an annual control campaign using baits that sterilised female foxes would reduce mean red fox population density by about 30\%. An annual campaign of poisoning (using the same effort as the sterilisation campaign) would reduce mean fox density by about 80\%. Payoff, in terms of reduced fox density, indicated that for any given bait density the payoff for poison baits was generally three to four times greater than for contraceptive baits. Additionally, integrated control---culling and fertility control---offered no advantage over culling only. For foxes, contraception delivered via bait is unlikely to provide a useful alternative to poisoning.},

  abstract = {In recent decades the `landscape of fear' has grown in popularity to become a central consideration in wildlife management, and has even been reconceptualized as the `landscape of coexistence' for understanding human-wildlife conflicts such as predator attacks on livestock. Yet fear effects are not always the predominant driver of predator-prey interactions. Thus, guiding ecological principles have not been assembled to explain the broader food web interactions that shape the context dependency of carnivore-livestock conflict. We address this gap by developing a conceptual framework as a way to think about the contingencies under which inducing non-consumptive `fear effects' on predators would be effective to mitigate carnivore-livestock conflict. The framework specifically considers interactions among wildlife (carnivore predators, wild ungulate prey) and humans (people and livestock) in terms of spatial predator-prey assemblages in which the nature of wildlife-human interactions -- as either a carnivore-livestock conflict or a coexistence food web -- is contingent on the nature of spatial movement and overlap of humans and wildlife across landscapes. Considering human-wildlife interactions within such a spatial food web context can assist in enabling people and wildlife, especially imperiled carnivores, to coexist in human-modified landscapes. The framework offers predictions that should be tested via adaptive management experiments that evaluate whether conflict mitigation solutions aligned with particular spatial human-livestock-carnivore contexts do indeed resolve conflict.},

  abstract = {Lethal carnivore management, aimed at reducing carnivore impacts, is a global phenomenon threatening the persistence of many carnivores. Black-backed jackals Canis mesomelas, the dominant cause of livestock predation in southern Africa, are widely hunted to reduce livestock predation. Despite centuries of lethal management, jackals persist. Smaller canids, like jackals, are highly adaptable and display variable responses to mortality sources, which may affect management outcomes. The effects of killing carnivores will depend on their behaviour, social organization, reproduction and dispersal patterns. We predicted that hunted jackals will alter demographic and reproductive patterns to compensate for increased mortality. Here, we collected demographic and reproductive information from harvested jackals and compared it between continually hunted (farms) and unmanaged populations (reserves). The removal of jackals from farms results in a decrease in median age from 5--6 years (reserves) to 2--3 years (farms). Hunting also changed the age structure of jackal populations from a stable population to an expanding population. This may be ascribed to the compensatory immigration of individuals from neighbouring unmanaged areas, suggesting the formation of a source--sink system. Unmanaged areas may act as source populations exporting young, dispersing individuals to hunted areas which may act as sinks. This is likely driven by disruptions in the normal, mutually exclusive territorial system resulting in low densities of conspecifics on farms. The low density of conspecifics allows younger individuals that would be socially precluded from reproducing to reproduce. Jackals on farms compensated for increased mortality by increasing the pregnancy rate of young individuals and increasing the litter size at younger ages, thereby increasing reproductive output. Synthesis and applications. The lethal management of predators is the prevailing strategy to reduce livestock predation. However, the highly adaptable nature of jackals and the combination of compensatory mechanisms such as increased reproduction and potential for immigration allow these predators to persist in the face of severe anthropogenic mortality, possibly through the formation of a source--sink system. These compensatory processes will continue to counter population management actions as long as recruitment from unmanaged areas persists.},

  abstract = {Climate change has different and sometimes divergent effects on terrestrial and marine food webs, and in coastal ecosystems, these effects are tightly interlinked. Responses of opportunistic coastal predators and scavengers to climate change may thus be complex and potentially highly flexible, and can simultaneously serve as indicators of, and have profound impacts on, lower trophic levels. Gaining mechanistic understanding of these responses is therefore important, but often not feasible due to lack of long-term data from marked individuals. Here, we used a Bayesian integrated population model (IPM) to elucidate the effects of arctic warming and concurrent changes in terrestrial and marine resource availability on population dynamics of the opportunistic arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus) in Svalbard. Joint analysis of four types of data (den survey, age-at-harvest, placental scars, mark-recovery) revealed relatively stable population size and age structure over the last 22 yr (1997--2019) despite rapid environmental change linked to climate warming. This was related to the fact that terrestrial resources (reindeer carcasses, geese) became more abundant while the availability of marine resources (seal pups/carrion) decreased, and was driven by divergent trends in different vital rates (e.g., increased pregnancy rate but decreased pup survival). Balanced contributions of survival vs. reproduction and of immigration vs. local demography further stabilized population size. Our study thus sheds light on the mechanisms underlying population dynamics of opportunistic carnivores exploiting terrestrial and marine resources and suggests that exploitation of resources across different ecosystems can buffer predators against climate change. Additionally, it highlights the large potential of IPMs as tools to understand and predict the effects of environmental change on wildlife populations, even when data on marked individuals are sparse.},

  abstract = {Expanding populations of mesopredators threaten biodiversity and human health in many ecosystems across the world. Lethal control through harvest is commonly implemented as a mitigation measure, yet the effects of harvest and its interaction with environmental conditions on mesopredator population dynamics have rarely been assessed quantitatively due to data constraints. Recent advances involving integrated populations models (IPMs) have enabled promising alternative approaches for quantitative assessments. Efficient use of multiple datasets, together with the ability to account for bias and uncertainty, make IPMs ideal tools for studying impacts of management actions and environmental conditions on harvested populations for which limited data is available. Here we developed a versatile IPM workflow for studying mesopredator population dynamics under different harvest regimes and applied it to an expanding population of red foxes in Arctic Norway. Our model combined routinely collected data on age, reproductive status, and genetic variation from {$>$}3600 harvested red foxes with opportunistic field observations and information published on red foxes elsewhere. This allowed us to quantify population dynamics over a period of 18 years, and to identify the drivers of changes in population growth rates using retrospective (Life Table Response Experiments, LTREs) and prospective (population viability analyses, PVAs) perturbation analyses. We found no long-term trends in population size over the course of our study period, not least due to intense harvest limiting the growth potential of the population. On shorter, year-to-year timescales, however, the numbers of red foxes could change dramatically due to responses of natural mortality and immigration to fluctuations in the availability of rodent prey. Our study highlights the potential of integrated modelling approaches for studying population dynamics even when no structured surveys of living animals are available and illustrates the value of extracting and curating information from harvested animals. Our semi-automated and reproducible modelling workflow is ready to be re-run periodically when new data becomes available for our study population and can easily be transferred and adapted to other harvested species, contributing to the development of cost-effective population analyses that are of high relevance for informing management strategies and mitigating biodiversity loss in practice.},

  abstract = {Throughout the Arctic, ice-affiliated marine mammals constitute local subsistence resources but detrimental effects of declines in their sea ice habitats create a need for harvest sustainability assessments in light of climate change. At the same time, empirical data required for thorough population analysis of these species are often sparse at best, as illustrated by the focal species in this study, ringed seals in Svalbard: the last population survey took place two decades ago (2002--2003), demographic data are limited to age, sex, and reproductive status of a small subset of shot individuals, and harvest reporting is patchy and incomplete. Data sparsity is one of the main reasons why potential biological removal (PBR) became a commonly used tool for assessing sustainability of marine mammal harvests. Herein, we calculated PBR for Svalbard ringed seals using both recommended default parameters and population-specific parameters obtained from an integrated population model (IPM). PBR estimates were highly uncertain, suggesting the number of sustainably harvestable individuals could lie anywhere between 0 and 91, with a substantial chance of any harvest being unsustainable under current environmental conditions and trends. Subsequent population viability analyses (PVAs) further confirmed that the current harvest was likely unsustainable, even in a scenario in which sea ice conditions would not deteriorate (and therefore lower pup survival) further. However, uncertainty in population projections was high, and forecasts thus not ideal for formulating management advice. Better forecasts will require more frequent population surveys and obtaining more knowledge regarding the links between vital rates and environmental conditions, both of which may be facilitated by the adoption of novel technology (e.g., drone monitoring, genetic studies). The modeling framework created in this study can be readily updated with new data as they become available, and can serve as a tool for adaptive management of this and other marine mammal populations.},

However, decades of such attempts to eradicate this significant agricultural and biodiversity pest in many countries have failed. We investigated the effectiveness of an uncoordinated and isolated shooting program to determine if it caused any change in red fox population density. We also determined whether shooting is more cost effective than poison baiting for fox control. First, we estimated the density of foxes on an agricultural study property using distance sampling and rates of bait uptake before and after a control program. Second, we estimated the costs associated with undertaking the control program and compared it to the estimated costs of undertaking poison baiting. Prior to control, we estimated a density of 4.18 foxes per square kilometre. After the control exercise, which removed 47 individuals in 12 nights, we estimated a density of 3.26 foxes per square kilometre. Our results provide evidence that one-off control programs are not effective in greatly reducing red fox density, even if the control effort is intensive. Where large-scale control programs cannot be coordinated, isolated programs should therefore involve follow-up campaigns to reduce population recovery. On a local scale, combinations of shooting and baiting may also provide maximum control impact at minimal cost.},

After wolves were placed on the endangered species list in 1973, the northern Minnesota wolf population increased and stabilized by the early 2000s. A wolf trophy hunt was introduced in 2012--2014 and then halted by a court order in December 2014. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources collected wolf radiotelemetry data for the years 2004--2019. Statistical analysis showed that wolf mortality remained close to constant from 2004 until the initiation of the hunt, and that mortality doubled with the initiation of the first hunting and trapping season in 2012, remaining at a nearly constant elevated level through 2019. Notably, average annual wolf mortality increased from 21.7\% before wolf hunting seasons (10.0\% by human causes and 11.7\% natural causes) to 43.4\% (35.8\% by human causes and 7.6\% natural causes). The fine-grained statistical trend implies that human-caused mortality increased sharply during the hunting seasons, while natural mortality initially dropped. After the hunt's discontinuation, human-caused mortality remained higher than prior to the hunting seasons throughout the five years of the available after-hunt radiotelemetry data.},

  abstract = {Managing the nonlethal effects of disturbance on wildlife populations has been a long-term goal for decision makers, managers, and ecologists, and assessment of these effects is currently required by European Union and United States legislation. However, robust assessment of these effects is challenging. The management of human activities that have nonlethal effects on wildlife is a specific example of a fundamental ecological problem: how to understand the population-level consequences of changes in the behavior or physiology of individual animals that are caused by external stressors. In this study, we review recent applications of a conceptual framework for assessing and predicting these consequences for marine mammal populations. We explore the range of models that can be used to formalize the approach and we identify critical research gaps. We also provide a decision tree that can be used to select the most appropriate model structure given the available data. Synthesis and applications: The implementation of this framework has moved the focus of discussion of the management of nonlethal disturbances on marine mammal populations away from a rhetorical debate about defining negligible impact and toward a quantitative understanding of long-term population-level effects. Here we demonstrate the framework's general applicability to other marine and terrestrial systems and show how it can support integrated modeling of the proximate and ultimate mechanisms that regulate trait-mediated, indirect interactions in ecological communities, that is, the nonconsumptive effects of a predator or stressor on a species' behavior, physiology, or life history.},

  abstract = {Understanding landscape impacts on gene flow is necessary to plan comprehensive management and conservation strategies of both the species of interest and its habitat. Nevertheless, only a few studies have focused on the landscape genetic connectivity of the European wildcat, an umbrella species whose conservation allows the preservation of numerous other species and habitat types. We applied population and landscape genetics approaches, using genotypes at 30 microsatellites from 232 genetically-identified wildcats to determine if, and how, landscape impacted gene flow throughout France. Analyses were performed independently within two population patches: the historical north-eastern patch and the central patch considered as the colonization front. Our results showed that gene flow occurred at large spatial scales but also revealed significant spatial genetic structures within population patches. In both population patches, arable areas, pastures and permanent grasslands and lowly fragmented forested areas were permeable to gene flow, suggesting that shelters and dietary resources are among the most important parameters for French wildcat landscape connectivity, while distance to forest had no detectable effect. Anthropized areas appeared highly resistant in the north-eastern patch but highly permeable in the central patch, suggesting that different behaviours can be observed according to the demographic context in which populations are found. In line with this hypothesis, spatial distribution of genetic variability seemed uneven in the north-eastern patch and more clinal in the central patch. Overall, our results highlighted that European wildcat might be a habitat generalist species and also the importance of performing spatial replication in landscape genetics studies.},

  abstract = {Population dynamics models can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of predator control. On a restricted area, one key process is the rate at which removed individuals are replaced by immigration. Since this rate is difficult and costly to estimate by field study, we develop an analytical method to approximate immigration rate that makes use of data obtained through the removal process itself. In Britain, red fox Vulpes vulpes control is undertaken by gamekeepers on privately-owned shooting estates. The fox cull on each estate derives from both local reproduction and immigration. The proportional contribution of immigration to the cull can be expected to be greater on smaller estates. We describe a mechanism by which the average annual cull per unit estate area on a very small estate approximates the annual rate of immigration. We used fox culling records from 534 estates across seven different landscape types and a Bayesian hierarchical model to relate the density of foxes culled to estate area, with immigration rate assumed to be equal to the model intercept. The posterior predictive distribution of annual immigration rate was lognormal with a median of 2.41 fox km-2 year-1 and a CV of 0.84. Posterior median estimates of immigration rate varied between landscapes, ranging from 0.86 to 4.13 fox km-2 year1. Immigration rate was higher in arable and pastural landscapes compared to upland landscapes. Variation in immigration rate broadly matched differences in fox density characteristic of the regional landscape type. This study presents a widely applicable method for quantifying immigration rate in populations that are subject to depletion, e.g. through culling. The use of the fox immigration rate estimate as an informative prior distribution in population dynamics models could help in evaluating effects of control on local fox populations and lead to improved control strategies.},

  abstract = {Lethal control is widely employed to suppress the numbers of target wildlife species within restricted management areas. The success of such measures is expected to vary with local circumstances affecting rates of removal and replacement. There is a need both to evaluate success in individual cases and to understand variability and its causes. In Britain, red fox (Vulpes vulpes) populations are culled within the confines of shooting estates to benefit game and wildlife prey species. We developed a Bayesian state-space model for within-year fox population dynamics within such restricted areas and fitted it to data on culling effort and success obtained from gamekeepers on 22 shooting estates of 2 to 36 km2. We used informative priors for key population processes---immigration, cub recruitment and non-culling mortality--that could not be quantified in the field. Using simulated datasets we showed that the model reliably estimated fox density and demographic parameters, and we showed that conclusions drawn from real data were robust to alternative model assumptions. All estates achieved suppression of the fox population, with pre-breeding fox density on average 47\% (range 20\%--90\%) of estimated carrying capacity. As expected, the number of foxes killed was a poor indicator of effectiveness. Estimated rates of immigration were variable among estates, but in most cases indicated rapid replacement of culled foxes so that intensive culling efforts were required to maintain low fox densities. Due to this short-term impact, control effort focussed on the spring and summer period may be essential to achieve management goals for prey species. During the critical March-July breeding period, mean fox densities on all estates were suppressed below carrying capacity, and some maintained consistently low fox densities throughout this period. A similar model will be useful in other situations to quantify the effectiveness of lethal control on restricted areas.},

When male mortality rates due to hunting were {$<$}20\%, the effect on antler size distribution and the reproductive value function were relatively small. However, as mortality due to hunting increased to 50\% in large individuals, the direct effects of hunting on mean antler size and reproductive value became evident.

  abstract = {The introduction of American mink (Neovison vison; hereafter mink) into Europe has had severe impacts on many native wildlife species, including the water vole (Arvicola amphibius) in mainland Britain. Although trapping has been widely used to attempt to control mink, managers have little direct evidence of its effect on mink density or distribution, particularly where immigration of mink from nearby areas is inevitable. Such evidence is needed to justify the use of lethal methods in conservation policy. During 2006--2010 we removed mink from the River Monnow Catchment in western Britain, using track-recording rafts to monitor continuously for mink presence, guiding a strategic trapping effort. The area monitored and trapped was increased in stages, from a core sub-catchment with 109 km of water-course in 2006, to a 421-km2 catchment with 203 km of water-course in 2009. In each successive sub-catchment, mink detection and capture rates declined rapidly to near-zero levels after trapping began. Detections and captures showed seasonal peaks in every year corresponding to known dispersal periods, but also declined steadily from year to year, with increasing periods in which we did not detect mink. These results suggested that each sub-catchment was cleared of mink within a few months, with subsequent captures attributable to immigration. On average, we detected each mink 5.1 times before capture (daily probability of detection = 0.059 per mink and raft), and trapped them 3.4 days after deploying traps in response. On average, mink entering the area were likely to have been present for less than 13 days before capture. Water voles had been extinct in the Monnow Catchment since the 1980s. During 2006--2008 (starting 6 months after mink trapping commenced), we released 700 captive-bred water voles into the treatment area to re-establish a wild population. Persistence of this population through the 4 years of the project was considered indicative of effective mink control. This study demonstrates that, even in a mainland context, a systematic trapping strategy can have a substantial impact on the density and distribution of a damaging species, in this case allowing the restoration of a native prey species. {\copyright} 2013 The Wildlife Society},

In this study, we examined whether trapper experience, trapping effort and trapping methods significantly affect capture rates of red fox Vulpes vulpes, stone marten Martes foina and pine marten M. martes. Data were collected from 58 trappers (35,774 trap-nights) in a 660-km2 study area during one trapping season. The main trapping methods used for foxes and martens with different types of traps were identified by multiple correspondence analyses on 424 trap sites. Generalised linear modelling showed that trapping methods, the length of time traps were set in the same place, trapper experience and the presence of captures in neighbouring trap sites significantly affect capture rates of foxes and martens. Given the high variability of capture rates among different combinations of these factors (0--3.4 captures/100 trap-nights for fox and 0.6--7.8 captures/100 trap-nights for martens), a separate trapping index should be calculated to detect trends in small carnivore populations.},

We estimated reproduction parameters on 358 females collected in three study areas in western France from 1st February 2002 to 31st January 2005. Placental scars (n\,=\,103) were described by macroscopic examinations using the following variables: (1) the width and (2) the aspect of placental scars, (3) the abundance of macrophages or the presence of blood, (4) the presence of swellings, (5) the presence and colour of a central band and (6) the presence and colour of lateral bands. A factorial correspondence analysis showed strong associations between the month when scars were examined and categories of variables. Staining on placental scars made macrophages more visible, facilitating identification of `active' placental scars, i.e. related to the last pregnancy. However, distinction between placental scars due to earlier pregnancies and resorptions was not possible. The staining method used provides a standard that could be useful for obtaining comparable and repeatable results. The mean number of placental scars was 4.85\,{\textpm}\,1.46 (n\,=\,103) per vixen. The mean number of embryos per vixen was 4.66\,{\textpm}\,1.35 (n\,=\,68) for yearlings and 5.53\,{\textpm}\,1.50 (n\,=\,96) for older females. Including percentages of barren vixens, the total population productivity was significantly smaller for yearlings (3.62\,{\textpm}\,1.86, n\,=\,158) than for older females (4.28\,{\textpm}\,1.75, n\,=\,186).

  abstract = {Human activities severely impact the distribution and behaviour of apex predators in numerous terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, with cascading effects on several species. Mesopredator outbreaks attributable to the removal of an apex predator have often been recorded and described in the literature as ``mesopredator release''. During recent decades several examples of the phenomenon have been observed and studied in many different parts of the world. In this paper, we quantitatively reviewed the existing literature on mesopredator release using two software packages (VOSviewer and CiteSpace) to investigate patterns and trends in author keywords through occurrences and temporal analyses, and creating relative network maps.~The results showed that even though the general scientific interest in mesopredator release has increased in recent decades, the vast majority of studies focus on canid species, leaving many other species or entire taxa (e.g., reptiles) understudied and under-described. The connection between invasive species and mesopredator release has only recently been more extensively explored and also the effects of apex predators declining in aquatic ecosystems are still only partially investigated. Due to the increasing effect of biological invasions, overfishing, and either the decline or the rise of apex predators in different parts of the world, we expect an even higher increase in interest and number of published documents on the subject. We also encourage widening the research focus beyond canids to include other important taxa.},

  abstract = {Several field data and experiments on a terrestrial vertebrates exhibited that the fear of predators would cause a substantial variability of prey demography. Fear for predator population enhances the survival probability of prey population, and it can greatly reduce the reproduction of prey population. Based on the experimental evidence, we proposed and analyzed a prey-predator system introducing the cost of fear into prey reproduction with Holling type-II functional response. We investigate all the biologically feasible equilibrium points, and their stability is analyzed in terms of the model parameters. Our mathematical analysis exhibits that for strong anti-predator responses can stabilize the prey-predator interactions by ignoring the existence of periodic behaviors. Our model system undergoes Hopf bifurcation by considering the birth rate r0 as a bifurcation parameter. For larger prey birth rate, we investigate the transition to a stable coexisting equilibrium state, with oscillatory approach to this equilibrium state, indicating that the greatest characteristic eigenvalues are actually a pair of imaginary eigenvalues with real part negative, which is increasing for r0. We obtained the conditions for the occurrence of Hopf bifurcation and conditions governing the direction of Hopf bifurcation, which imply that the prey birth rate will not only influence the occurrence of Hopf bifurcation but also alter the direction of Hopf bifurcation. We identify the parameter regions associated with the extinct equilibria, predator-free equilibria and coexisting equilibria with respect to prey birth rate, predator mortality rates. Fear can stabilize the predator-prey system at an interior steady state, where all the species can exists together, or it can create the oscillatory coexistence of all the populations. We performed some numerical simulations to investigate the relationship between the effects of fear and other biologically related parameters (including growth/decay rate of prey/predator), which exhibit the impact that fear can have in prey-predator system. Our numerical illustrations also demonstrate that the prey become less sensitive to perceive the risk of predation with increasing prey growth rate or increasing predators decay rate.},

  abstract = {Predicting population responses to environmental conditions or management scenarios is a fundamental challenge for conservation. Proper consideration of demographic, environmental and parameter uncertainties is essential for projecting population trends and optimal conservation strategies. We developed a coupled integrated population model-Bayesian population viability analysis to assess the (1) impact of demographic rates (survival, fecundity, immigration) on past population dynamics; (2) population viability 10 years into the future; and (3) efficacy of possible management strategies for the federally endangered Great Lakes piping plover Charadrius melodus population. Our model synthesizes long-term population survey, nest monitoring and mark--resight data, while accounting for multiple sources of uncertainty. We incorporated latent abundance of eastern North American merlins Falco columbarius, a primary predator of adult plovers, as a covariate on adult survival via a parallel state-space model, accounting for the influence of an imperfectly observed process (i.e. predation pressure) on population viability. Mean plover abundance increased from 18 pairs in 1993 to 75 pairs in 2016, but annual population growth () was projected to be 0.95 (95\% CI 0.72--1.12), suggesting a potential decline to 67 pairs within 10 years. Without accounting for an expanding merlin population, we would have concluded that the plover population was projected to increase ( = 1.02; 95\% CI 0.94--1.09) to 91 pairs by 2026. We compared four conservation scenarios: (1) no proposed management; (2) increased control of chick predators (e.g. Corvidae, Laridae, mammals); (3) increased merlin control; and (4) simultaneous chick predator and merlin control. Compared to the null scenario, chick predator control reduced quasi-extinction probability from 11.9\% to 8.7\%, merlin control more than halved (3.5\%) the probability and simultaneous control reduced quasi-extinction probability to 2.6\%. Synthesis and applications. Piping plover recovery actions should consider systematic predator control, rather than current ad hoc protocols, especially given the predicted increase in regional merlin abundance. This approach of combining integrated population models with Bayesian population viability analysis to identify limiting components of the population cycle and evaluate alternative management strategies for conservation decision-making shows great utility for aiding recovery of threatened populations.},

  abstract = {Community ecology was traditionally an integrative science devoted to studying interactions between species and their abiotic environments in order to predict species' geographic distributions and abundances. Yet for philosophical and methodological reasons, it has become divided into two enterprises: one devoted to local experimentation on species interactions to predict community dynamics; the other devoted to statistical analyses of abiotic and biotic information to describe geographic distribution. Our goal here is to instigate thinking about ways to reconnect the two enterprises and thereby return to a tradition to do integrative science. We focus specifically on the community ecology of predators and prey, which is ripe for integration. This is because there is active, simultaneous interest in experimentally resolving the nature and strength of predator--prey interactions as well as explaining patterns across landscapes and seascapes. We begin by describing a conceptual theory rooted in classical analyses of non-spatial food web modules used to predict species interactions. We show how such modules can be extended to consideration of spatial context using the concept of habitat domain. Habitat domain describes the spatial extent of habitat space that predators and prey use while foraging, which differs from home range, the spatial extent used by an animal to meet all of its daily needs. This conceptual theory can be used to predict how different spatial relations of predators and prey could lead to different emergent multiple predator--prey interactions such as whether predator consumptive or non-consumptive effects should dominate, and whether intraguild predation, predator interference or predator complementarity are expected. We then review the literature on studies of large predator--prey interactions that make conclusions about the nature of multiple predator--prey interactions. This analysis reveals that while many studies provide sufficient information about predator or prey spatial locations, and thus meet necessary conditions of the habitat domain conceptual theory for drawing conclusions about the nature of the predator--prey interactions, several studies do not. We therefore elaborate how modern technology and statistical approaches for animal movement analysis could be used to test the conceptual theory, using experimental or quasi-experimental analyses at landscape scales.},

  abstract = {Understanding survival probabilities is critical for the sustainable harvest of wildlife and fisheries populations. Age- and stage class-specific survival probabilities are needed to inform a suite of population models used to estimate abundance and track population trends. However, current techniques for estimating survival probabilities using age-at-harvest methods require restrictive assumptions or incorporate potentially unknown parameters within the model. Using a Bayesian approach, we developed a flexible age-at-harvest model that incorporates either age- or stage-structured populations, while accounting for uncertainty in age structure, population growth rates and relative selectivity. Survival probabilities can vary by age or stage class, as well as by environmental covariates, and both population growth rates and selectivity for each age or stage class can be specified as fixed and known or these parameters can be specified as informative priors, allowing for the incorporation of expert opinion. We evaluated our model with simulations and empirical data from harvested bobcats Lynx rufus and American paddlefish Polyodon spathula. Models fit to simulated age-at-harvest data yielded unbiased estimates of survival probability when population growth rates and selectivity were centered on the data-generating parameter. We obtained unbiased estimates of survival probability even with biased prior estimates of selectivity and random departures from the assumed stage distribution, although the latter increased uncertainty in those estimates. We found biased estimates of survival probability when the prior distribution for population growth rate was not centered on the data-generating value. When fit to empirical harvest data, our proposed age-at-harvest model produced estimates of survival probability congruent to those reported in the literature within similar geographic regions. We demonstrate the utility of a novel age-at-harvest model that estimates survival probability and realistically account for uncertainty in model parameters, transcending the restrictive assumptions and auxiliary data requirements of other methods. Furthermore, we advise collecting information about population trends and age structure alongside age-at-harvest data to help reduce bias. Although our model cannot replace more rigorous methods, we believe our model will be transformative for wildlife and fisheries practitioners who collect age-at-harvest data to estimate age- or stage-specific survival probabilities to help inform management decisions.},

For individually marked species, capture--recapture models provide robust population estimates, but for unmarked species, inference is often based on relative abundance indices (RAI, number of records per trap effort), although these do not account for imperfect and variable detection. We use a simulation study and empirical camera-trapping data to illustrate how ecological and sampling-related factors can bias RAIs. Our simulations showed that (1) differences in detection between species led to bias in RAI ratios toward the more detectable species, especially at low detection levels, (2) species with larger home ranges were photographed more often, inflating RAIs, (3) species specific responses to different types of trap setup biased RAI ratios, and (4) changes in detection over time blurred true population trends inferred from RAIs. Empirical data for leopard cats Prionailurus bengalensis and common palm civets Paradoxurus hermaphroditus showed that traps set up along roads led to higher RAIs than off-road traps, but targeting roads increased detection more for leopard cats than for common palm civets. Comparing RAIs of Sunda clouded leopards Neofelis diardi and leopard cats with spatial capture--recapture based density estimates across sites, RAIs did not reflect differences in density. Analytical options for estimating density from camera-trapping data of unmarked populations are limited. Consequently, we fear that RAIs will continue to be applied. This is alarming, since these measures often form the basis for conservation and management decisions. We suggest considering alternative analytical and survey methods, especially when dealing with threatened species.},

  abstract = {Harvesting is often size-selective, and in species with sexual size dimorphism, it may also be sex-selective. A powerful approach to investigate potential consequences of size- and/or sex-selective harvesting is to simulate it in a demographic population model. We developed a population-based integral projection model for a size- and sex-structured species, the commonly exploited pike (Esox lucius). The model allows reproductive success to be proportional to body size and potentially limited by both sexes. We ran all harvest simulations with both lower size limits and slot limits, and to quantify the effects of selective harvesting, we calculated sex ratios and the long-term population growth rate ({$\lambda$}). In addition, we quantified to what degree purely size-selective harvesting was sex-selective, and determined when {$\lambda$} shifted from being female to male limited under size- and sex-selective harvesting. We found that purely size-selective harvest can be sex-selective, and that it depends on the harvest limits and the size distributions of the sexes. For the size- and sex-selective harvest simulations, {$\lambda$} increased with harvest intensity up to a threshold as females limited reproduction. Beyond this threshold, males became the limiting sex, and {$\lambda$} decreased as more males were harvested. The peak in {$\lambda$}, and the corresponding sex ratio in harvest, varied with both the selectivity and the intensity of the harvest simulation. Our model represents a useful extension of size-structured population models as it includes both sexes, relaxes the assumption of female dominance, and accounts for size-dependent fecundity. The consequences of selective harvesting presented here are especially relevant for size- and sex-structured exploited species, such as commercial fisheries. Thus, our model provides a useful contribution toward the development of more sustainable harvesting regimes.},

  abstract = {1. A 6-year experiment is described which was designed to test whether or not predation control, as practised by traditional and currently legal methods, increases (i) the breeding success and autumn numbers of partridges, and (ii) the subsequent breeding density. 2. In the experiment, predation control effort was highly seasonal and designed to reduce partridge breeding season losses by killing resident predators of selected species. 3. The predation control significantly reduced the abundance of foxes, carrion crows and magpies during the critical partridge nesting period. 4. After the nesting period, predators re-established themselves each year, during late summer and early autumn. 5. The predation control significantly increased the proportion of partridges that bred successfully and the average size of their broods, thus substantially improving the production of young. Excluding effects of site and year predation control increased August numbers by 75\%. Incorporating the effects on breeding stocks in subsequent years this led to an overall 3{$\cdot$}5-fold difference between autumn populations with and without predation control. 6. Predation control significantly increased partridge breeding stocks the following year. Breeding stocks in years following predation control were 36\% larger than stocks in years that did not follow predation control-excluding the effects of year and site. After 3 years this had produced a 2{$\cdot$}6-fold difference in breeding density between the sites with and without predation control. 7. These results suggest that predators play a key role in limiting production and subsequent breeding density of partridges.},

  abstract = {Fires are becoming increasingly frequent, intense, severe and prolonged worldwide, and such situation is worsening. As a result, extreme fire conditions will increase, with consequences for wildlife, including increased mass mortality and changes in trophic relationships in natural communities. This intensification is expected to be particularly pronounced in the Mediterranean ecosystems. In this scoping review, we summarized current knowledge and gaps in understanding the effects of fires on wildlife, focusing on predator--prey interactions. These interactions play a critical role in animal communities and their understanding is fundamental for appropriate management and conservation. Mammals were chosen as a model group because of their remarkable ecological role. We grouped and analysed the post-wildfire changes in the predator--prey relationships into three-time intervals: immediate, short- and long-term effects. This is relevant as vegetation restoration, by altering cover and habitat structure, may affect hunting strategies and anti-predatory behaviour. Our review showed that studies generally had several limitations, the most common of which were the lack of replication, the strong geographical bias, and the focus on few target species. Nevertheless, we could formally describe how fire affects predator--prey relationships in Mediterranean ecosystems through processes that exert different cascading effects at different times after the fire event. We encourage long-term studies on communities, including as many components of the food chain as possible, using an interdisciplinary approach, and prioritising investigations in high-risk ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Context The European red fox (Vulpes vulpes) is subject to control by poison baiting in many parts of its range in Australia to protect both native and domestic species. Assessments of baiting programs can improve their effectiveness and help ensure that long-term control outcomes are achieved. Aims We describe spatial and temporal patterns of bait uptake by the red fox in remnant forest within an agricultural matrix, including multiple bait-takes and hotspots of activity over time, and examine the response of foxes to baiting operations. Methods We analysed bait uptake (Foxoff{\textregistered}) from 12 baiting operations over 5 years in the Goonoo forest, a 62 500 ha remnant surrounded by cleared land in central New South Wales, Australia. More than 8000 checks of bait-stations were analysed to provide indices of fox activity per bait-check, patterns of bait removal during bait-checks, and bait uptake at stations within and across operations. Fox activity was also assessed before and after four operations using sand plots. Key results There was no consistent decline in relative fox activity in relation to changes in bait-take; increases in the activity index occurred in successive checks within most operations. Spatial analyses of checks within control operations showed that consecutive baits were removed at more than 70\% of bait stations that were visited by foxes. Temporal analyses showed further that within an operation, multiple bait-takes occurred at {\textasciitilde}20\% of stations and, across all operations, hot spots of activity could be identified. Conclusions A short (2-week) baiting window in standard baiting operations may not be effective in reducing the activity of foxes across the landscape. It is likely that many baits are being cached during each operation, and that foxes move into the baited area from unbaited surrounding areas. Implications More frequent and timely baiting operations are needed to achieve maximum disruption to the fox population in the remnant forest environment, at least as indicated by patterns of bait-take. Increasing the distance between baits, to {\textasciitilde}1.5 km, while reducing baiting-gaps at the landscape scale, will also be important to reduce caching and still ensure that baits are encountered.},

  abstract = {Selective harvest, such as trophy hunting, can shift the distribution of a quantitative character such as body size. If the targeted character is heritable, then there will be an evolutionary response to selection, and where the trait is not, then any response will be plastic or demographic. Identifying the relative contributions of these different mechanisms is a major challenge in wildlife conservation. New mathematical approaches can provide insight not previously available. Here we develop a size- and age-based two-sex integral projection model based on individual-based data from a long-term study of hunted bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) at Ram Mountain, Canada. We simulate the effect of trophy hunting on body size and find that the inheritance of body mass is weak and that any perceived decline in body mass of the bighorn population is largely attributable to demographic change and environmental factors. To our knowledge, this work provides the first use of two-sex integral projection models to investigate the potential eco-evolutionary consequences of selective harvest.},

  abstract = {Recently, hunting has represented a major source of mortality in game animals, including red fox, Vulpes vulpes, populations. Data from hunting studies have been used to explain evolutionary changes (body size, dental structure) in fox populations; however, knowledge of potential sources of bias in these kinds of data is lacking. Moreover, nature and game managers as well as conservationists have recently been seeking methods to limit European fox populations, which are increasing. In the present study in Polish farmland, we show that three different hunting methods (individual -- lying in wait, with dogs at dens, with beating undergrowth to flush out foxes) resulted in differences in the age, sex ratio and body size of shot foxes. Taking account of seasonal differences in hunting methods used, shooting assisted by beating gave a higher proportion of male foxes, whereas individual hunting resulted in smaller foxes in shot samples. Hunting with dogs resulted in heavier female foxes, with the results being skewed towards females. Thus, this method may help limit the breeding capacity of a population and is recommended to assist in the control of red fox populations, at least in farmland areas.},

For example, age-specific survival rates can be estimated with just a single sample from the age distribution of a stable, stationary population. For a population that is not stable, age-specific survival rates can be estimated using techniques such as inverse methods that combine time series of age-structure data with other demographic data. However, estimation of survival rates using these methods typically requires numerical optimization, a relatively long time series of data, and smoothing or other constraints to provide useful estimates. We developed general models for possibly unstable populations that combine time series of age-structure data with other demographic data to provide explicit maximum likelihood estimators of age-specific survival rates with as few as two years of data. As an example, we applied these methods to estimate survival rates for female bison (Bison bison) in Yellowstone National Park, USA. This approach provides a simple tool for monitoring survival rates based on age-structure data.},

  abstract = {Crocodile populations are size-structured, and for populations that are subject to harvesting, removal is typically size selective. For this reason, size-structured matrix models are typically used to analyse the dynamics of crocodile populations. The boundaries between the size classes used to classify individuals in these models are typically chosen arbitrarily. This is problematic because results can depend upon the number and width of size classes. The recent development of continuous character population models termed integral projection models (IPM) has removed the need to arbitrarily classify individuals. These models are yet to be applied to harvested animal populations. Using information obtained from the literature, we develop an IPM for crocodiles. We use perturbation analyses to investigate how altering size-specific demographic rates influences the population growth rate and the strength of selection on snout to vent length. We find that perturbations can lead to complex responses. Sensitivity analysis to population growth and fertility selection reveals that the smallest animals and the sizes of early breeding individuals and their eggs may have more influence on these population biology parameters than previously thought. Although our model is relatively simple, our results show that IPM can be used to gain theoretical insight into the possible consequences of altering size-specific demographic rates on the population and evolutionary ecology of harvested populations.},

  abstract = {Expansion of boreal species into tundra ecosystems is a consequence of climate change and human exploitation that threatens local species through increased predation, competition, and pathogen transmission. Under these circumstances, efficient control of expanding boreal species may be necessary, but the efficiency of such action depends on understanding the ecological influences of expansion. The red fox (Vulpes vulpes) is expanding into the tundra across the Arctic. In Scandinavia, red foxes threaten local tundra species and communities including the endangered Arctic fox (V. lagopus). The ecological dynamics in the tundra are influenced by small rodent cycles (classified into different phases based on seasonal abundance fluctuations), which can affect red fox expansion, distribution, and abundance. We used a 17-year (2004--2020) dataset from the tundra in Sweden, consisting of raw snow track data, to test how cyclic prey influenced red fox distribution and abundance, and subsequently red fox control. The winter abundance of red fox was influenced by small rodent phase, with higher abundance during high prey availability (i.e., increased number of prey numbers) with no support for a time lag between red fox and small rodent abundance. This suggests that high prey availability attracts red foxes to the tundra and that higher immigration from the boreal zone can be expected in response to increased prey abundances. There was no relationship between red fox control and small rodent availability, but control was influenced by red fox abundance during the previous year, which highlights an opportunistic control strategy. We recommend an adaptive management strategy where authorities include small rodent dynamics in the planning and execution of red fox control.},

We first investigated the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List species-level assessments for each mustelid species. Then, we undertook a systematic review of the scientific literature with the aim of identifying the primary threats and subthreats reported, and which species are most studied. Threats are defined by the IUCN as ``the proximate human activities or processes that have impacted, are impacting, or may impact the status of the taxon''. We analysed 1003 published articles. For each article, we collected year of publication, geographical zone of each study, species studied, and the threats and subthreats identified. The majority of species (62\%) were classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, but 31 out of 63 species were found to be declining globally and only two species were increasing. The species studied and location of studies were biased, with 72\% of studies undertaken in North America or Europe and focussing on very few species. A high proportion of species distributed predominantly in the tropics were categorised as declining, and threats linked with hunting, fishing, and logging were identified as the most common for mustelids by the IUCN Red List and in the scientific literature. Differences in the proportion of threats affecting each subfamily were also reported. The nature of threats varies in different parts of the world and between species. It is essential to undertake more research with a strong focus towards species in highly biodiverse regions. A greater understanding of threats such as wildlife pet trade, emerging diseases, and climate change must also be central to prevent declines.},

  abstract = {Predators can strongly influence prey populations not only through consumptive effects (CE) but also through non-consumptive effects (NCE) imposed by predation risk. Yet, the impact of NCE on bioenergetic and stoichiometric body contents of prey, traits that are shaping life histories, population and food web dynamics, is largely unknown. Moreover, the degree to which NCE can evolve and can drive evolution in prey populations is rarely studied. A 6-week outdoor mesocosm experiment with Caged-Fish (NCE) and Free-Ranging-Fish (CE and NCE) treatments was conducted to quantify and compare the effects of CE and NCE on population densities, bioenergetic and stoichiometric body contents of Daphnia magna, a keystone species in freshwater ecosystems. We tested for evolution of CE and NCE by using experimental populations consisting of D. magna clones from two periods of a resurrected natural pond population: a pre-fish period without fish and a high-fish period with high predation pressure. Both Caged-Fish and Free-Ranging-Fish treatments decreased the body size and population densities, especially in Daphnia from the high-fish period. Only the Free-Ranging-Fish treatment affected bioenergetic variables, while both the Caged-Fish and Free-Ranging-Fish treatments shaped body stoichiometry. The effects of CE and NCE were different between both periods indicating their rapid evolution in the natural resurrected population. Both the Caged-Fish and Free-Ranging-Fish treatments changed the clonal frequencies of the experimental Daphnia populations of the pre-fish as well as the high-fish period, indicating that not only CE but also NCE induced clonal sorting, hence rapid evolution during the mesocosm experiment in both periods. Our results demonstrate that CE as well as NCE have the potential to change not only the body size and population density but also the bioenergetic and stoichiometric characteristics of prey populations. Moreover, we show that these responses not only evolved in the studied resurrected population, but that CE and NCE also caused differential rapid evolution in a time frame of 6 weeks (ca. four to six generations). As NCE can evolve as well as can drive evolution, they may play an important role in shaping eco-evolutionary dynamics in predator--prey interactions.},
