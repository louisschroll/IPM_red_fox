> [!faq] Background and Introduction
- **Context**:  Pest control is a global issue for agriculture, health, biodiversity conservation and economy. Anticoagulant rodenticides are used over large areas to control rodent pests and can cause widespread poisoning of nontarget wildlife. In France, bromadiolone is the only pesticide authorized to control the water vole Arvicola terrestris Scherman, in grasslands. Since 2001, legislation has been in place to replace curative treatments by preventive ones and limit the quantity of rodenticide used. As the legislation took effect over time, the impact on red fox Vulpes vulpes populations was monitored.
- **Research Question**:  1. Is the impact of treatment on fox populations dependent on bromadiolone quantities used, and, if so, were the measures implemented to reduce bromadiolone use sufficient to mitigate the impacts? 2. Is there a delayed impact on fox populations and what is their recovery pattern?

> [! example] Methodology
- **Study Population**:  red fox in the Doubs
- **Sample Size**:  472 geo-referenced transects, 1–2 km in length, distributed over the Doubs Department
- **Data**:  Fox counts (night spotlight counts) ; Shot fox numbers
- **Measured Variables**:  Kilometric Abundance Index: KAI
- **Model**:

> [! done] Results
- Kilometric Abundance Index of foxes was significantly related to treatment intensities in years n-1 and n-2.
- on a regional scale, the negative impact of a rodenticide on fox populations

- **Interpretation of Results**:  
- **Study Limitations**:  correlative nature, confound might be that the baiting reduced vole populations, thereby depleting food availability
- **Comparison to Previous Research**:  
- **Main Conclusion**:  
- **Practical Implications**:  
- **Suggestions for Future Research**:

> [! quote] Key Quotes
- Foxes temporarily specialize on grassland voles when those prey are available (Raoul et al. 2010) and are relatively sedentary compared with raptors. Therefore, this species appears to be a relevant sentinel species to assess the effects of rodenticide field treatment on predator populations.
- Due to a short data acquisition time frame, carcass collection can signal the need to urgently cease treatment in response to massive mortality.
- our long-term monitoring demonstrates that populations were affected for more than one year, which supports two nonexclusive hypotheses: delayed poisoning and/or a time of longer than 1 year is required for fox population recovery.
- higher recruitment rates into impacted populations due to decreased intraspecific competition.
- This recolonization is a strong possibility because foxes are able to disperse over considerable distance and, consequently, might swiftly recolonize areas from which they have been removed (Gentle, Saunders & Dickman 2007).
