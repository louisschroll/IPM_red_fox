> [!faq] Background and Introduction
- **Context**:  Use of pesticides affect predator of pest species, diminishing their ecosystem services. It is the case with anticoagulant rodenticides on foxes and mustelids
- **Research Question**:  What is the impact of the use of anticoagulant rodenticides on predator populations? 

---

> [! example] Methodology
- **Study Population**:  simulated fox, mustelids and small rodents
- **Data**:  no data, simulation 
- **Model**: process-based models
---

> [! done] Results
- Summarize the key results.
- Include important statistics (p-values, confidence intervals, etc.).

---

> [! error] Discussion & conclusion
- **Interpretation of Results**:  In many cases, the control of vole by anticoagulant trigger the disappearance of predator ecosystem services, thus creating a dependence on rodenticide treatments for controlling rodents populations.
- **Study Limitations**:  
- **Comparison to Previous Research**:  
- **Practical Implications**:  The current practice of maintaining low vole density (even with low dose anticoagulant treatment) lead to the depletion of vole predator community. An intermediate vole density associated with intermediate treatment allow predator density to rebound while simultaneously avoiding high peak in vole density.
- **Suggestions for Future Research**:  landscape modelling approach to characterize spatial refuges ; avoid one-species–one-compound approach

- Natural enemies are, however, also affected by pesticides, either by direct exposure, through ingestion of contaminated prey (Berny, 2007) or indirectly through cascading consequences of effects of resource depletion (Halstead et al., 2014).
- Voles and many small rodents are perceived as pests, but they are also keystone species, crucial to the functioning of grassland and forest ecosystems, as well as being the prey of numerous predators, including species of conservation concern (Coeurdassier et al., 2014; DelibesMateos, Smith, Slobodchikoff, & Swenson, 2011).
- Generalist resident predators like foxes (Vulpes vulpes) are expected to have regulatory and limiting effects on voles, owing to dietary plasticity that slows down vole population increase at low density (Hanski et al., 1991). Foxes do not show numerical responses to vole abundance (Weber et al., 2002) but they influence the food chain through occasional killing and consumption of bite-sized mustelids. Mustelids form a small proportion of fox diet (0%–10%) but their offtake could represent a significant portion of the population (reviewed in Lambin, 2018).
- Anticoagulant rodenticides are non-selective toxicants with deleterious effects on non-target fauna
- Consumption of dead and sub-lethally intoxicated voles reduced fox abundance in farmland in eastern France (Jacquot et al., 2013)
- Considering that rodenticide kills not only voles but also their predators through secondary poisoning, our models show that AR profoundly changes the modelled outcome of predator–prey dynamics involving vole, mustelid and fox populations beyond what mere intuition could elucidate.
- the dual influences of the amount of pesticide spread and the vole density threshold triggering AR spread drive (a) pesticide spreading frequency, (b) predation ecosystem service, and subsequently (c) the control of pest outbreaks.
- over time, farmers who strictly maintain voles at low density thresholds would likely suppress predation services provided by vole predators and, in so doing, instigate pesticide dependence.
- Triggering treatment at intermediate vole density with a low amount of AR (scenario D) allows for temporal refuges, i.e. longer periods free of rodenticide necessary for predator densities to rebound while simultaneously avoiding episodes with high vole density, as required by farm production interests.
- the practice currently promoted to use low-dose AR treatments at low vole density could have the undesirable side effects of leading to chronic application of AR on a large scale, in the absence of refuges, and the depletion of the vole predator community
