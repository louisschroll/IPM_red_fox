  abstract = {Forests within agricultural landscapes can act as safe harbourages for species that conflict with neighbouring landowners’ interests, including mammalian predators. The agency responsible for the management of forests in upland Wales, UK, has permitted the killing of foxes (Vulpes vulpes) on their land as a “good neighbour policy” with the aim of reducing fox numbers. The principal method used was the use of dogs to drive foxes to a line of waiting shooters; a small number of foxes were also killed by shooting at night with a rifle. However, it has been postulated that recent restrictions on the use of dogs to kill foxes in Britain could lead to an increase in fox numbers in plantations. The aim of this study was to determine whether over-winter culling (i.e. driving foxes to guns using dogs and rifle shooting) in these forests acted to reduce fox density. Fox faecal density counts were conducted in commercial forests in Wales in autumn 2003 and spring 2004. Data were analysed from 29 sites (21 individual forests and 8 forest blocks, the latter consisting of pooled data from 20 individual forests). The over-winter change in faecal density was negatively related to the proportion of felled land and the proportion of land more than 400~m altitude, these associations probably reflecting reduced food availability. Over-winter change was positively associated with culling pressure (i.e. more foxes were killed where more foxes were present, or vice versa), but this was not significant. The number of foxes killed was large relative to the estimated resident population, but losses appeared to be negated (most likely) by immigration. Pre-breeding (spring) faecal density counts were significantly positively related to culling pressure, i.e. more foxes were killed with increased fox density or vice versa. Overall, there was no evidence to suggest that culling reduced fox numbers. Consequently, restrictions on the use of dogs to control foxes are unlikely to result in an increase in fox numbers in commercial forests.},

  abstract = {Context Optimal management of invasive species should determine the interval between lethal-control operations that will sustain a desired population suppression at minimum cost. This requires an understanding of the species’ rate of recruitment following control. These data are difficult to acquire for vertebrate carnivores such as the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), which are not readily trapped or observed. Aims To provide a long-term evaluation of the effects of 1080 poison baiting on the abundance and extent of movement of red foxes in a semiarid environment. Methods We used non‐invasive DNA sampling of fox hairs in semi-arid Western Australia where the population was subject to two episodes of aerially delivered sodium fluoroacetate (1080) poison baits within 12 months. Sampling took place at \textasciitilde 45-day intervals and individual foxes were identified by genotyping eight microsatellite DNA markers and a gender-specific marker. Open-population and spatially explicit mark–recapture models were used to estimate the density, apparent survival and movements of foxes before and following baiting. Key results Following a severe reduction in density after baiting, fox density during the ensuing 12 months increased slowly (0.01 foxes km–2 month–1), such that density had only reached 22\% of pre-baiting levels \textasciitilde 10 months after the initial baiting. Moreover, recovery was non‐linear as population growth was negligible for 6 months, then exhibited a nine-fold increase 7–9 months after control, coincident with the dispersal of juveniles in autumn. Fox movements between recaptures were on average 470\% greater after baiting than before, in line with expectations for low-density populations, suggesting that the probability of encountering baits during this period would be higher than before baiting. Conclusions Baiting with 1080 poison significantly reduced the density of foxes, and the low density was sustained for more than 6 months. Foxes moved significantly further between recaptures after baiting when at low densities. Implications Control programs in this region may be carried out at low frequency to suppress fox density to a fraction of unbaited levels. The intensity of follow-up baiting may also be adjusted downwards, to take account of an increased probability of bait encounter in more mobile foxes.},

  abstract = {1. Carnivore overabundance that results from exploitation of human derived resources can have numerous detrimental effects on local human populations and ecological communities. Experimental studies on the responses of overabundant carnivores to reductions of such resources are necessary to understand the effectiveness and impacts of resource reduction. 2. We conducted controlled experiments in two villages in which we drastically reduced the availability of anthropogenic food sources in half of each village. Spatial and numerical responses of radio-collared red foxes Vulpes vulpes were recorded and contrasted with those of radio-collared foxes in three similar untreated villages and pristine areas in the region. In total, we looked at survival rates of 134 foxes. 3. Prior to the resource manipulation, home range sizes (0·47 and 0·56 km2) and population densities (30 and 36 foxes km−2) in the two villages were comparable to documented low and high-end values, respectively. 4. Fast and distinct spatial responses were observed in response to the resource manipulation, and were manifested in either increased home range size or home range shifts. In one village, foxes exposed to reduced resource availability more than doubled their home range size. 5. Survival rates of individuals in the treated areas were drastically reduced. Actual fox mortality in the two treated areas reached 100\% and 64\% within 12 months of the onset of resource manipulation. Estimated monthly survival in the two treated areas declined from 0·96–0·98 and 0·98–0·99 (∼0·69 and 0·78 derived annual survival) before treatment to 0·80–0·83 and 0·92–0·94 (∼{$<$}0·01 and 0·42 derived annual survival) after treatment, respectively. By contrast, average monthly survivorship in pristine areas was nearly 0·97 (∼0·69 annual survival) and in the untreated areas and other non-treated villages was 0·95–0·99 (∼0·54–0·89 annual survival). 6. Synthesis and applications. This study demonstrates that sound waste disposal measures are very effective in controlling populations of overabundant carnivores. Contrary to common notion, the response of foxes to reduced resources was fast, manifested more by reduced survival than by successful dispersal into adjacent pristine areas. The results offer support to the Resource Dispersion Hypothesis regarding both home range size and density (suggested by the sharp decrease in survival) as a function of the spatial and temporal dispersion of resource.},

  abstract = {Over several decades, Western Europe experienced an outbreak of sylvatic rabies, eliminated through an EU programme involving large-scale red fox vaccination campaigns. While much work has been done on the dynamics of the virus and on the efficiency of vaccination campaigns, very little attention has been paid to the impact on the large-scale dynamics of the fox population. As Western Europe has now been free of rabies for about 15–20 years, the aims of this review are to characterise the impact of rabies during the outbreak itself and to increase understanding of how fox populations evolved thereafter. The rabies-free populations in the UK are also integrated as a comparative control. Trends in fox populations are based on a review of available data, mainly hunting statistics and a few other methods. The benefits and biases of these methods are also discussed. During the rabies epizootic, fox populations experienced a significant decline and stabilised at lower densities than observed in the past. A demographic explosion followed the vaccination campaigns, and fox populations became larger than had been observed before the epizootic. Rabies vaccination was not the direct cause of this demographic explosion, as rabies-free areas experienced it also. The causes are more to be sought in environmental modifications induced by humans. This demographic explosion was followed by the emergence of urban fox populations throughout Europe. Moreover, the new higher densities favoured the outbreak of other diseases, though their impact was more limited. Around the 2000s, rural fox populations appeared to reach densities close to carrying capacity and populations stabilised. However, subsequently, with some exceptions, Western European fox populations seem to be experiencing a decline. The ecological consequences of these changes in fox population density may reach the many prey species and competitors of the red fox.},

  abstract = {Populations of the same species often face different selection pressures and, increasingly, the demography of populations within a species has been shown to be highly variable. Knowledge of such intraspecific differences has implications for substituting demographic data, a practice that is often necessary for population modelling due to missing parameters. The red fox Vulpes vulpes, a widely-studied, widespread and economically important species, offers an opportunity to consider the degree of intraspecific variability in the demography of a carnivore and to test the consequences of interpopulation data substitution. We use published life history data to review the extent and quality of demographic data for fox populations. Using demographic descriptors, matrix models, and perturbation analyses, we identify important demographic properties and classify interpopulation variation along the fast–slow continuum. We also illustrate the consequences of data substitution in demographic models. Data quality varies substantially between reviewed studies. Sufficient data exist to model the demography of eight of 56 study populations. Modelled populations have a tendency towards positive population growth, with survival and fecundity of the youngest age class contributing most to that growth. Metrics point to strategies ranging from medium to fast life histories. While broad demographic similarities exist among fox populations, our results imply considerable demographic variation between populations. We show that significant differences in model outcomes based on substituted data are dependent on the parameter replaced, and that geographic proximity does not imply demographic similarity. Superficially, the red fox appears to have been well studied, yet there are remarkably few usable demographic data from much of its range. Despite 70 years of published studies, we were unable to examine the effects on demographic parameters of harvesting regimes, density and weather. We propose improvements to enhance the value of demographic data, both for foxes and for other species.},

  abstract = {Many animal populations are subject to hunting or fishing in the wild. Detailed knowledge of demographic parameters (e.g. survival, reproduction) and temporal dynamics of such populations is crucial for sustainable management. Despite their relevance for management decisions, structure and size of exploited populations are often not known, and data limited. Recently, joint analysis of different types of demographic data, such as population counts, reproductive data and capture–mark–recapture data, within integrated population models (IPMs) has gained much popularity as it may allow estimating population size and structure, as well as key demographic rates, while fully accounting for uncertainty. IPMs built so far for exploited populations have typically been built as age-structured population models. However, the age of harvested individuals is usually difficult and/or costly to assess and therefore often not available. Here, we introduce an IPM structured by body size classes, which allows making efficient use of data commonly available in exploited populations for which accurate information on age is often missing. The model jointly analyzes size-at-harvest data, capture–mark–recapture–recovery data and reproduction data from necropsies, and we illustrate its applicability in a case study involving heavily hunted wild boar. This species has increased in abundance over the last decades despite intense harvest, and the IPM analysis provides insights into the roles of natural mortality, body growth, maturation schedules and reproductive output in compensating for the loss of individuals to hunting. Early maturation and high reproductive output contributed to wild boar population persistence despite a strong hunting pressure. We thus demonstrate the potential of size-class-structured IPMs as tools to investigate the dynamics of exploited populations with limited information on age, and highlight both the applicability of this framework to other species and its potential for follow-up analyses highly relevant to management.},

We sought to assess the effects of predator-control programs by analyzing changes in prey and predator populations based on data commonly collected in these programs. We examined data from a predator-control program that primarily targets the introduced red fox ( Vulpes vulpes regalis) in central California. Red foxes negatively affect populations of native waterbirds, particularly the endangered California Clapper Rail ( Rallus longirostris obsoletus). Using a combination of matrix population modeling, simple difference equations, and statistical analysis, we analyzed data on removed predators and monitored prey populations. Past control efforts succeeded in depressing fox numbers in local areas over 3-month intervals, and there was a significant, positive relationship between the growth rate of local Clapper Rail populations and the successful trapping of red foxes in the preceding year. By modeling the effect of different fox-removal rates, we found that a stable or declining population could be achieved by removing a minimum of 50\% of the adults and 25\% of the juveniles. Under trapping rates of 50–70\%, the proportion of the fox population composed of immigrants averaged 20–52\%. In contrast to the current management approach, elasticity analyses suggested that changes in adult survival rates had relatively little effect on long-term population growth. Overall, our approach indicated that predator control was effective in the short term, but for longer-term success it may be necessary to redirect efforts to control juvenile and immigrant foxes. Our analytical approach is potentially useful for evaluating current control programs aimed at reducing the effects of predators on native species.},

  abstract = {The impact of deliberate culling of fox populations has been much debated. Although a local ({$<$} 10 km2) impact has been accepted, previous authors have denied that culling has any impact on a larger scale because local losses are compensated through immigration. Rather, it has been claimed that at this scale fox density is determined by resources, mediated through social behaviour and breeding suppression. We determined the impact of culling on a regional scale ({$>$} 1000 km2), using data on culling (Heydon \& Reynolds, 2000), fox density (Heydon, Reynolds \& Short, 2000) and productivity. The three U.K. study regions (size 1238–2322 km2) were in mid-Wales (A), the east Midlands (B) and East Anglia (C). High productivity in regions A and C was associated with low density, high culling mortality and high overall mortality (all relative to region B), indicating that density was suppressed by culling. In region B (moderate) breeding suppression was associated with a higher density and lower cull than in regions A and C, implying that fox density was closer to the maximum sustainable by resources. We conclude that the impact of culling in different regions of Britain is variable, dependent on the regional prevalence, methods, and history of culling. However, it is clear that in a range of circumstances culling can substantially depress fox numbers, and that current fox densities reflect a history of culling. This conclusion is fundamental in considering the management of fox predation in farming and conservation contexts.},

The red fox (Vulpes vulpes) poses a significant threat to wildlife, livestock and human health across Eurasia, North America and Australia. Despite worldwide investment in red fox management, decision makers still lack flexible tools for predicting control efficacy. We have developed FoxNet, a spatially explicit, individual-based model (IBM) framework that can be customised to predict red fox population dynamics, including responses to control and landscape productivity. High-resolution models can be run across northern and southern hemisphere landscapes. We present four case-study models to verify FoxNet outputs, explore key sensitivities and demonstrate the framework's utility as a management planning tool. FoxNet models were largely successful in reproducing the demographic structure of two red fox populations in highly contrasting landscapes. They also accurately generated the relationship between home-range size and fox-family density for home-range sizes between 1.0 and 9.6 km2, and captured the rapid decline and seasonally driven recovery of a red fox population following poison-baiting. An exploration of alternative poison-baiting scenarios for a conservation reserve predicted that current management suppresses red fox density by 70\% and showed that frequent baiting is required to combat recolonisation. Baiting at higher densities or establishing a baited buffer would further reduce red fox density. Predictions were sensitive to home-range and litter size assumptions, illustrating the value of region-specific data on red fox movement and biology. Synthesis and applications. We have developed a versatile individual-based model framework to guide management of the red fox, a globally significant invasive predator. Our framework, FoxNet, can be customised to generate realistic predictions of red fox population dynamics in diverse landscapes, making it immediately applicable to the design and optimisation of predator control programmes at scales relevant to management. Future extensions could explore competitor and prey responses to red fox control and the effects of habitat disturbance on predator population dynamics.},

  abstract = {Predators are often culled to benefit prey, but in many cases this conservation goal is not achieved or results remain unknown. The red fox (Vulpes vulpes) is a predator of global significance, and an invasive species in some regions. Red fox culls intended to benefit prey are often restricted to small areas, and effectiveness is rarely sufficiently evaluated. Given the economic, ecological, social, and welfare issues associated with lethal predator control, there is a strong need to assess the effects of spatiotemporal variation in culling intensity on red fox abundance. We surveyed red fox populations in fragmented forests of south-western Germany and related indices of local fox abundance to culling data, predicted landscape-scale fox abundance, and other covariates. We tested whether restricted-area culling was associated with local reductions in fox abundance, and examined how this relationship changed over time. Local fox abundance was temporarily reduced in spring, following winter culls. However, the effect was minor and fox populations had compensated for the reductions at the latest by autumn. Restricted-area culling therefore likely failed to sustain effects on fox abundance throughout the period most relevant for conservation (i.e., the reproductive period of the target prey species). To be effective as a conservation tool, culling will therefore require explicit spatiotemporal coordination matching the biology of predators and target prey.},

  abstract = {Context Predator-control aims to reduce an impact on prey species, but efficacy of long-term control is rarely assessed and the reductions achieved are rarely quantified. Aims We evaluated the changing efficacy of a 58-year-long campaign against red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) on Phillip Island, a 100-km2 inhabited island connected to the Australian mainland via a bridge. The campaign aimed to eliminate the impact of foxes on ground-nesting birds, particularly little penguins (Eudyptula minor). Methods We monitored the success rate of each fox-control technique employed, the level of effort invested if available, demographics of killed foxes, the numbers of penguins killed by foxes and penguin population size. Key results The campaign began as a bounty system that ran for 30 years and was ineffective. It transitioned into a coordinated, although localised, control program from 1980 to 2005 that invested considerable effort, but relied on subjective assessments of success. Early during the control period, baiting was abandoned for less effective methods that were thought to pose fewer risks, were more enjoyable and produced carcasses, a tangible result. Control was aided by a high level of public awareness, by restricted fox immigration, and by a clear, achievable and measurable target, namely, to prevent little penguin predation by foxes. Carcasses did prove valuable for research, revealing the genetic structure and shifts in fox demographics. The failure of the program was evident after scientific evaluation of fox population size and ongoing fox impacts. In 2006, the campaign evolved into an eradication attempt, adopting regular island-wide baiting, and since then, has achieved effective knock-down of foxes and negligible predation on penguins. Conclusions Effective predator control was achieved only after employing a dedicated team and implementing broad-scale baiting. Abandoning widespread baiting potentially delayed effective control for 25 years. Furthermore, both predator and prey populations should be monitored concurrently because the relationship between predator abundance and impact on prey species is not necessarily density dependent. Implications Critical to adopting the best management strategy is evaluating the efficacy of different methods independently of personal and public biases and having personnel dedicated solely to the task.},

  abstract = {Invasive mammalian predators are implicated in the ongoing decline of a suite of fauna and continue to be a major cause of human–wildlife conflict globally. Lethal control of invasive predators is a common management strategy; however, the use of activity indices to measure management effectiveness is problematic. Non-invasive genetic sampling may be a viable alternative approach to monitoring as individual animals can be identified, allowing for direct estimation of population density through newly developed spatially explicit capture–recapture techniques. Here we compare inferences derived from a basic activity index (number of scats per survey) and genetic sampling of scats within a before–after control–impact design to evaluate the effectiveness of a lethal control programme targeting red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) in south-eastern Australia. The activity index was highly variable through time and suggested the baiting programme reduced fox activity on the treatment transect relative to changes on the non-treatment transect. In contrast, genetic sampling and spatially explicit capture–recapture analysis suggested fox density varied little throughout the study, with any changes unable to be attributed to the baiting programme. Additionally, genetic sampling confirmed many individuals persisted through 7 months of baiting. These contrasting results may be partially explained by changes in scat detectability due to seasonal changes in behaviour and the disproportionate contribution of some individuals to scat counts. Our pre-baiting density estimate of 0.28 foxes km2 (95\% CI: 0.22–0.38) was lower than expected given the high productivity, abundant prey species and lack of larger predators in the study region. Our results highlight the need for cautious interpretation of activity indices and demonstrates the value of incorporating recent methodological and statistical advances when evaluating lethal control programmes.},

We investigated whether the pattern of senescence of a medium-sized, fast-living and heavily-culled mammal, the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), fits this theoretical prediction. We used cross-sectional data from a large-scale culling experiment of red fox conducted over six years in five study sites located in two regions of France to explore the age-related variation in reproductive output. We used both placental scars and embryos counts from 755 vixens’ carcasses aged by the tooth cementum method (age range: 1–10), as proxies for litter size. Mean litter size per vixen was 4.7 ± 1.4. Results from Generalized Additive Mixed Models revealed a significant variation of litter size with age. Litter size peaked at age 4 with 5.0 ± 0.2 placental scars and decreased thereafter by 0.5 cubs per year. Interestingly, we found a different age-specific variation when counting embryos which reached a plateau at age 5–6 (5.5 ±0.2) and decreased slower than placental scars across older ages, pointing out embryo resorption as a potential physiological mechanism of reproductive senescence in the red fox. Contrary to our expectation, reproductive senescence is weak, occurs late in life and takes place at an age reached by less than 11.7\% of the population such that very few females exhibit senescence in these heavily culled populations.},

The main methods of controlling foxes rely on poison baiting, den fumigation and den destruction. There are concerns that ongoing use of poisons and fumigants may become unacceptable on the grounds of humaneness. Additional control options that are humane and effective need to be investigated. In this study we developed models to examine the efficacy of using contraceptive agents as an alternative method of control for fox populations. The models simulated the dynamics of structured (by age and sex) fox populations. The models were then used to identify the level of infertility required to achieve target levels of control, the need for ongoing maintenance, and the benefits of an integrated pest management strategy that included lethal control. The models indicated that an annual control campaign using baits that sterilised female foxes would reduce mean red fox population density by about 30\%. An annual campaign of poisoning (using the same effort as the sterilisation campaign) would reduce mean fox density by about 80\%. Payoff, in terms of reduced fox density, indicated that for any given bait density the payoff for poison baits was generally three to four times greater than for contraceptive baits. Additionally, integrated control—culling and fertility control—offered no advantage over culling only. For foxes, contraception delivered via bait is unlikely to provide a useful alternative to poisoning.},

  abstract = {Climate change has different and sometimes divergent effects on terrestrial and marine food webs, and in coastal ecosystems, these effects are tightly interlinked. Responses of opportunistic coastal predators and scavengers to climate change may thus be complex and potentially highly flexible, and can simultaneously serve as indicators of, and have profound impacts on, lower trophic levels. Gaining mechanistic understanding of these responses is therefore important, but often not feasible due to lack of long-term data from marked individuals. Here, we used a Bayesian integrated population model (IPM) to elucidate the effects of arctic warming and concurrent changes in terrestrial and marine resource availability on population dynamics of the opportunistic arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus) in Svalbard. Joint analysis of four types of data (den survey, age-at-harvest, placental scars, mark-recovery) revealed relatively stable population size and age structure over the last 22 yr (1997–2019) despite rapid environmental change linked to climate warming. This was related to the fact that terrestrial resources (reindeer carcasses, geese) became more abundant while the availability of marine resources (seal pups/carrion) decreased, and was driven by divergent trends in different vital rates (e.g., increased pregnancy rate but decreased pup survival). Balanced contributions of survival vs. reproduction and of immigration vs. local demography further stabilized population size. Our study thus sheds light on the mechanisms underlying population dynamics of opportunistic carnivores exploiting terrestrial and marine resources and suggests that exploitation of resources across different ecosystems can buffer predators against climate change. Additionally, it highlights the large potential of IPMs as tools to understand and predict the effects of environmental change on wildlife populations, even when data on marked individuals are sparse.},

  abstract = {Throughout the Arctic, ice-affiliated marine mammals constitute local subsistence resources but detrimental effects of declines in their sea ice habitats create a need for harvest sustainability assessments in light of climate change. At the same time, empirical data required for thorough population analysis of these species are often sparse at best, as illustrated by the focal species in this study, ringed seals in Svalbard: the last population survey took place two decades ago (2002–2003), demographic data are limited to age, sex, and reproductive status of a small subset of shot individuals, and harvest reporting is patchy and incomplete. Data sparsity is one of the main reasons why potential biological removal (PBR) became a commonly used tool for assessing sustainability of marine mammal harvests. Herein, we calculated PBR for Svalbard ringed seals using both recommended default parameters and population-specific parameters obtained from an integrated population model (IPM). PBR estimates were highly uncertain, suggesting the number of sustainably harvestable individuals could lie anywhere between 0 and 91, with a substantial chance of any harvest being unsustainable under current environmental conditions and trends. Subsequent population viability analyses (PVAs) further confirmed that the current harvest was likely unsustainable, even in a scenario in which sea ice conditions would not deteriorate (and therefore lower pup survival) further. However, uncertainty in population projections was high, and forecasts thus not ideal for formulating management advice. Better forecasts will require more frequent population surveys and obtaining more knowledge regarding the links between vital rates and environmental conditions, both of which may be facilitated by the adoption of novel technology (e.g., drone monitoring, genetic studies). The modeling framework created in this study can be readily updated with new data as they become available, and can serve as a tool for adaptive management of this and other marine mammal populations.},

  abstract = {Expanding populations of mesopredators threaten biodiversity and human health in many ecosystems across the world. Lethal control through harvest is commonly implemented as a mitigation measure, yet the effects of harvest and its interaction with environmental conditions on mesopredator population dynamics have rarely been assessed quantitatively due to data constraints. Recent advances involving integrated populations models (IPMs) have enabled promising alternative approaches for quantitative assessments. Efficient use of multiple datasets, together with the ability to account for bias and uncertainty, make IPMs ideal tools for studying impacts of management actions and environmental conditions on harvested populations for which limited data is available. Here we developed a versatile IPM workflow for studying mesopredator population dynamics under different harvest regimes and applied it to an expanding population of red foxes in Arctic Norway. Our model combined routinely collected data on age, reproductive status, and genetic variation from {$>$}3600 harvested red foxes with opportunistic field observations and information published on red foxes elsewhere. This allowed us to quantify population dynamics over a period of 18 years, and to identify the drivers of changes in population growth rates using retrospective (Life Table Response Experiments, LTREs) and prospective (population viability analyses, PVAs) perturbation analyses. We found no long-term trends in population size over the course of our study period, not least due to intense harvest limiting the growth potential of the population. On shorter, year-to-year timescales, however, the numbers of red foxes could change dramatically due to responses of natural mortality and immigration to fluctuations in the availability of rodent prey. Our study highlights the potential of integrated modelling approaches for studying population dynamics even when no structured surveys of living animals are available and illustrates the value of extracting and curating information from harvested animals. Our semi-automated and reproducible modelling workflow is ready to be re-run periodically when new data becomes available for our study population and can easily be transferred and adapted to other harvested species, contributing to the development of cost-effective population analyses that are of high relevance for informing management strategies and mitigating biodiversity loss in practice.},

However, decades of such attempts to eradicate this significant agricultural and biodiversity pest in many countries have failed. We investigated the effectiveness of an uncoordinated and isolated shooting program to determine if it caused any change in red fox population density. We also determined whether shooting is more cost effective than poison baiting for fox control. First, we estimated the density of foxes on an agricultural study property using distance sampling and rates of bait uptake before and after a control program. Second, we estimated the costs associated with undertaking the control program and compared it to the estimated costs of undertaking poison baiting. Prior to control, we estimated a density of 4.18 foxes per square kilometre. After the control exercise, which removed 47 individuals in 12 nights, we estimated a density of 3.26 foxes per square kilometre. Our results provide evidence that one-off control programs are not effective in greatly reducing red fox density, even if the control effort is intensive. Where large-scale control programs cannot be coordinated, isolated programs should therefore involve follow-up campaigns to reduce population recovery. On a local scale, combinations of shooting and baiting may also provide maximum control impact at minimal cost.},

  abstract = {Lethal control is widely employed to suppress the numbers of target wildlife species within restricted management areas. The success of such measures is expected to vary with local circumstances affecting rates of removal and replacement. There is a need both to evaluate success in individual cases and to understand variability and its causes. In Britain, red fox (Vulpes vulpes) populations are culled within the confines of shooting estates to benefit game and wildlife prey species. We developed a Bayesian state-space model for within-year fox population dynamics within such restricted areas and fitted it to data on culling effort and success obtained from gamekeepers on 22 shooting estates of 2 to 36 km2. We used informative priors for key population processes—immigration, cub recruitment and non-culling mortality–that could not be quantified in the field. Using simulated datasets we showed that the model reliably estimated fox density and demographic parameters, and we showed that conclusions drawn from real data were robust to alternative model assumptions. All estates achieved suppression of the fox population, with pre-breeding fox density on average 47\% (range 20\%–90\%) of estimated carrying capacity. As expected, the number of foxes killed was a poor indicator of effectiveness. Estimated rates of immigration were variable among estates, but in most cases indicated rapid replacement of culled foxes so that intensive culling efforts were required to maintain low fox densities. Due to this short-term impact, control effort focussed on the spring and summer period may be essential to achieve management goals for prey species. During the critical March-July breeding period, mean fox densities on all estates were suppressed below carrying capacity, and some maintained consistently low fox densities throughout this period. A similar model will be useful in other situations to quantify the effectiveness of lethal control on restricted areas.},

  abstract = {Population dynamics models can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of predator control. On a restricted area, one key process is the rate at which removed individuals are replaced by immigration. Since this rate is difficult and costly to estimate by field study, we develop an analytical method to approximate immigration rate that makes use of data obtained through the removal process itself. In Britain, red fox Vulpes vulpes control is undertaken by gamekeepers on privately-owned shooting estates. The fox cull on each estate derives from both local reproduction and immigration. The proportional contribution of immigration to the cull can be expected to be greater on smaller estates. We describe a mechanism by which the average annual cull per unit estate area on a very small estate approximates the annual rate of immigration. We used fox culling records from 534 estates across seven different landscape types and a Bayesian hierarchical model to relate the density of foxes culled to estate area, with immigration rate assumed to be equal to the model intercept. The posterior predictive distribution of annual immigration rate was lognormal with a median of 2.41 fox km-2 year-1 and a CV of 0.84. Posterior median estimates of immigration rate varied between landscapes, ranging from 0.86 to 4.13 fox km-2 year1. Immigration rate was higher in arable and pastural landscapes compared to upland landscapes. Variation in immigration rate broadly matched differences in fox density characteristic of the regional landscape type. This study presents a widely applicable method for quantifying immigration rate in populations that are subject to depletion, e.g. through culling. The use of the fox immigration rate estimate as an informative prior distribution in population dynamics models could help in evaluating effects of control on local fox populations and lead to improved control strategies.},

  abstract = {We tested a staining method on uteri for counting placental scars on red fox. We estimated reproduction parameters on 358 females collected in three study areas in western France from 1st February 2002 to 31st January 2005. Placental scars (n\,=\,103) were described by macroscopic examinations using the following variables: (1) the width and (2) the aspect of placental scars, (3) the abundance of macrophages or the presence of blood, (4) the presence of swellings, (5) the presence and colour of a central band and (6) the presence and colour of lateral bands. A factorial correspondence analysis showed strong associations between the month when scars were examined and categories of variables. Staining on placental scars made macrophages more visible, facilitating identification of ‘active’ placental scars, i.e. related to the last pregnancy. However, distinction between placental scars due to earlier pregnancies and resorptions was not possible. The staining method used provides a standard that could be useful for obtaining comparable and repeatable results. The mean number of placental scars was 4.85\,±\,1.46 (n\,=\,103) per vixen. The mean number of embryos per vixen was 4.66\,±\,1.35 (n\,=\,68) for yearlings and 5.53\,±\,1.50 (n\,=\,96) for older females. Including percentages of barren vixens, the total population productivity was significantly smaller for yearlings (3.62\,±\,1.86, n\,=\,158) than for older females (4.28\,±\,1.75, n\,=\,186). We discuss these results in relation to fox densities, culling and food availability.},

  abstract = {1 The successful introduction of the red fox Vulpes vulpes into Australia in the 1870s has had dramatic and deleterious impacts on both native fauna and agricultural production. Historical accounts detail how the arrival of foxes in many areas coincided with the local demise of native fauna. Recent analyses suggest that native fauna can be successfully reintroduced to their former ranges only if foxes have been controlled, and several replicated removal experiments have confirmed that foxes are the major agents of extirpation of native fauna. Predation is the primary cause of losses, but competition and transmission of disease may be important for some species. 2 In agricultural landscapes, fox predation on lambs can cause losses of 1–30\%; variation is due to flock size, health and management, as well as differences in the timing and duration of lambing and the density of foxes. 3 Fox control measures include trapping, shooting, den fumigation and exclusion fencing; baiting using the toxin 1080 is the most commonly employed method. Depending on the baiting strategy, habitat and area covered, baiting can reduce fox activity by 50–97\%. We review patterns of baiting in a large sheep-grazing region in central New South Wales, and propose guidelines to increase landholder awareness of baiting strategies, to concentrate and coordinate bait use, and to maximize the cost-effectiveness of baiting programs. 4 The variable reduction in fox density within the baited area, together with the ability of the fox to recolonize rapidly, suggest that current baiting practices in eastern Australia are often ineffective, and that reforms are required. These might include increasing landholder awareness and involvement in group control programs, and the use of more efficient broadscale techniques, such as aerial baiting.},

  abstract = {Context The European red fox (Vulpes vulpes) is subject to control by poison baiting in many parts of its range in Australia to protect both native and domestic species. Assessments of baiting programs can improve their effectiveness and help ensure that long-term control outcomes are achieved. Aims We describe spatial and temporal patterns of bait uptake by the red fox in remnant forest within an agricultural matrix, including multiple bait-takes and hotspots of activity over time, and examine the response of foxes to baiting operations. Methods We analysed bait uptake (Foxoff®) from 12 baiting operations over 5 years in the Goonoo forest, a 62 500 ha remnant surrounded by cleared land in central New South Wales, Australia. More than 8000 checks of bait-stations were analysed to provide indices of fox activity per bait-check, patterns of bait removal during bait-checks, and bait uptake at stations within and across operations. Fox activity was also assessed before and after four operations using sand plots. Key results There was no consistent decline in relative fox activity in relation to changes in bait-take; increases in the activity index occurred in successive checks within most operations. Spatial analyses of checks within control operations showed that consecutive baits were removed at more than 70\% of bait stations that were visited by foxes. Temporal analyses showed further that within an operation, multiple bait-takes occurred at \textasciitilde 20\% of stations and, across all operations, hot spots of activity could be identified. Conclusions A short (2-week) baiting window in standard baiting operations may not be effective in reducing the activity of foxes across the landscape. It is likely that many baits are being cached during each operation, and that foxes move into the baited area from unbaited surrounding areas. Implications More frequent and timely baiting operations are needed to achieve maximum disruption to the fox population in the remnant forest environment, at least as indicated by patterns of bait-take. Increasing the distance between baits, to \textasciitilde 1.5 km, while reducing baiting-gaps at the landscape scale, will also be important to reduce caching and still ensure that baits are encountered.},

  abstract = {Recently, hunting has represented a major source of mortality in game animals, including red fox, Vulpes vulpes, populations. Data from hunting studies have been used to explain evolutionary changes (body size, dental structure) in fox populations; however, knowledge of potential sources of bias in these kinds of data is lacking. Moreover, nature and game managers as well as conservationists have recently been seeking methods to limit European fox populations, which are increasing. In the present study in Polish farmland, we show that three different hunting methods (individual – lying in wait, with dogs at dens, with beating undergrowth to flush out foxes) resulted in differences in the age, sex ratio and body size of shot foxes. Taking account of seasonal differences in hunting methods used, shooting assisted by beating gave a higher proportion of male foxes, whereas individual hunting resulted in smaller foxes in shot samples. Hunting with dogs resulted in heavier female foxes, with the results being skewed towards females. Thus, this method may help limit the breeding capacity of a population and is recommended to assist in the control of red fox populations, at least in farmland areas.},
