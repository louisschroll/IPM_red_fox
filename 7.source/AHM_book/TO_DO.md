## AHM code

# TO DO list

## Additional material needed for AHM2

At many points in the book it says that full code or additional code is available on the website. Most of that has been inserted into the scripts for the relevant (sub)section. Code to produce most of the plots has also been added.

The only item still outstanding is:

* 7.6.6 "We conducted a small simulation study to evaluate the influence of the coupled occupancy model on classification (see the book website for code)." and Figure 7.5.
